sutra: एत ऐ
vRtti: लोडुत्तमसम्बन्धिन एकारस्य ऐकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The \"_ai_\" is substituted for \"_e_\" forming part of the affixes of the first person of the Imperative.

This relates to the _Atmanepada_ affix. Thus करवै, करवावहै, करवामहै ।

But the ए resulting from _sandhi_, is not to be changed into ऐ । Thus पचाव + इदम् = पचावेदम्, पचाम + इदम् = पचामेदम् । Here, no doubt, the ए belongs to the Imperative by (VI. 1. 85), being the substitute of अ of म and व. But this is not to be changed into ऐ on the maxim that this ए is the result of a बहिरङ्ग rule, for the rule of _sandhi_ (VI. 1. 87), is a बहिरङ्ग rule, while the present _sutra_ is an अन्तरङ्ग rule; because of the following _Paribhasha_, असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे 'that which is _Bahiranga_ is regarded as not having taken effect, when an _Antaranga_ rule is to be applied.
