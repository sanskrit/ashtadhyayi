sutra: हलः श्नः शानज्झौ
vRtti: हल उत्तरस्य श्नाप्रत्ययस्य शानजादेशो भवति हौ परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix शानच् is the substitute of श्ना after a root ending with a consonant, when हि follows.
---
The affix हि is the 2nd person singular of लोट् or the Imperative mood. Thus पुषाण 'do thou nourish', गृहाण do thou take', from roots पुष् and ग्रह which end with consonants. But we have क्रीणीहि 'do thou buy'; here there is no substitution of शानच्, because the root ends with a vowel. The repetition of श्ना in the _sutra_ shows that शानच् is a mere substitute and not an independent affix.
