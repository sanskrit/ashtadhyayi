vRtti: दुह स्नु नम् इत्येतेषां कर्मकर्तरि यक्चिणौ कर्मवद्भावापदिष्टौ न भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix यक् (III. 1. 67) and चिण् (III. 1. 62) are not employed in the reflexive voice of the verbs दुह् 'to milk', स्नु 'to fall in drops' and नम् 'to bow'.

The affixes यक् and चिण् are used in forming the reflexive verbs, when the action affecting the agent is similar to the action which affects the object. With regard to the root दुह्, the affix यक् is only prohibited by the present _sutra_; the चिण् being optionally employed by rule (III. I. 63), as दुग्धे, अदुग्ध or अदोहि गौः स्वयमेव 'the cow flows or flowed of itself', प्रस्नुते or प्रास्नीष्ट गौः स्वयमेव 'the cow flows or flowed of itself'; नमते or अनंस्त दण्डः स्वयमेव 'the stick bends or bent of itself'.

This prohibition of the employment of the affixes यक् and चिण् is extended to the verbs that take the affix णि (such as causatives &c.), to the verbs श्रन्थ 'to loosen', मन्थ 'to compose' and ब्रू 'to speak', and to the _Atmanepadi_. Intransitive verbs. As कारयते 'it is caused to be made of itself; अचीकरत् 'it was caused to be made of itself; श्रथ्नीते 'it loosens of itself'; अश्रथ्निष्ट 'it loosened of itself'; मथ्नीते; अमथ्निष्ट 'it composes or composed of itself'; ब्रूते and अवोचत् 'it speaks and spoke of itself'; आहते and आवधिष्ट माणवकः स्वयमेव.
