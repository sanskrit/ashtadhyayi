sutra: कृत्यैरधिकार्थवचने
vRtti: कर्तृ करण्योर्या तृतीया तदन्तं सुबन्तं कृत्यैः सह समस्यते अधिकार्थचने गम्यमाने विभाषा, तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: A word ending with the third case-affix when it denotes the agent or the instrument, is compounded optionally with a word ending in a _kritya_ affix, when an exaggerated statement (whether of praise or of censure) is implied, and the compound is _Tat-purusha_.

As काकपेयानदी 'a shallow river' (so shallow that a crow may dip his beak into it and touch the bottom and drink). श्वलेह्य कूपः 'a shallow well' (so that a dog can lick water from the brink of it). वाष्पच्छेद्यानि तृणानि 'thin grass' (so fragile that it can be cut by vapour) कण्टकसञ्चेय ओदनः .

This _sūtra_ is in a way a prolongation of the last .

Vart:-The phrase 'words ending in a _kritya_ affix' must not be taken universally, only the _kritya_ affixes यत् and ण्यत् are meant in the above _sutras_. The following are the _kritya_ affixes :- तव्य, अनीय, यत्, क्यप्, ण्यत्, (see _sutra_ III.1.95-132). Therefore there is no compounding when the word ends in तव्य as in काकैः पातव्या.
