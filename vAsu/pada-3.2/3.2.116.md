sutra: हशश्वतोर्लङ् च
vRtti: भूतानद्यतनपरोक्षेऽर्थे लिटि प्राप्ते हशश्वतोरुपपदयोर्लङ्प्रत्ययो भवति चकाराल्लिट् च ॥
vRtti_eng: And the affix लङ् comes after a verb when the particles ह and शश्वत् are in connection with it, and when the verb denotes past action unperceived by the speaker, and before the commencement of the current day.

The force of च 'and' is that the affix लिट् (perfect) may also be employed in similar construction. As इति हाकरोत् (imperfect), or इति ह चकार (perfect) 'Alas ! he did it'. शश्वदकरोत् or शश्वच्चकार 'again and again he did it'.
