sutra: आत्ममाने खश्च
vRtti: अत्ममाने वर्त्तमानान्मन्यतेः सुप्युपपदे खश्प्रत्ययो भवति, चकाराण्णिनिश्च ॥
vRtti_eng: And the affix खश् comes after the verb मन् \"to think\" when the word in composition with it is a word with a case-affix, and when it is employed to signify thought, whereof the object is self (the sense of the affix being \"thinking himself as such\").

---
The word आत्ममान means thinking of one's own self. By the word 'and' it is meant that the affix णिनि may be employed in the same sense. This rule applies where the agent, indicated by the sense of the affix, thinks himself possessed of the qualities of 'handsomeness' &c., denoted by the _upapada_. As दर्शनीयम्मन्यः or दर्शनीयमानी 'who thinks himself handsome'; पण्डितम्मन्यः or पण्डितमानी 'who thinks himself learned'.

Why do we say 'when employed to signify thought whereof the object is self'? Witness दर्शनीयमानी देवदत्तस्य यज्ञदत्तः ' _Yajnadatta_ is thought handsome by _Devadatta_'.

Of the affix खश् the letter ख् causes मुम् augment by (VI. 3. 66); and श् makes it a _sarvadhatuka_ affix, which brings in the proper _vikaranas_. The affixes so far treated of are applicable in all tenses. The others that follow denote some particular time.
