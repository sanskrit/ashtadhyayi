sutra: अत्र लोपोभ्यासस्य
vRtti: यदेतत्प्रक्रान्तं सनि मीमेत्यादि मुचोकर्मकस्य गुणेवेति यावत् अत्राभ्यासलोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The reduplicate is dropped under the circumstances mentioned in the foregoing _ sutras_ (VII. 4. 54) to (VII. 4. 57).

---
The examples are given under the above-mentioned _sutras_. The word 'of the reduplicate' अभ्यासस्य is to be supplied in all the subsequent _sutras_ upto the end of the chapter. Thus _Sutra_ (VII.4.59), says 'a short is to be substituted', we must supply the words 'for the reduplicate' to complete the sense: as डुढौकिषते, तुत्रौकिषते ॥ The word अत्र in the _sutra_ indicates that the reduplication is not to be elided, when an affix is treated like सन् but is not actually सन् ॥ Thus चङ्-Aorist is treated like सन् by (VII.4.93); but the reduplication will not be dropped there : as, अमीमपत्, अदीदपत् ॥ Some say the word अत्र here indicates that the whole of the reduplicate is dropped, and not only its final letter. Others elide the whole of the reduplicate on the maxim  नानर्थकोऽलोऽन्त्यविधिः ॥ "The rule (I. I. 52), by which a substitute should take the place of only the final letter of that which is exhibited in the Genitive case, is not valid, where what is exhibited in the Genitive is meaningless".
