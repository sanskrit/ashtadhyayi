sutra: शा हौ
vRtti: शासो हौ परतः शा इत्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Before the Imperative affix हि, शा is substituted for शास् ॥

Thus अनुशाधि, प्रशाधि ॥ The हि is changed to धि by (6.4.101). See (6.4.22). The _anuvritti_ of उपधायाः is not here, so शा is substituted in the room of the full word शास् and not only for the penultimate vowel of  शास् ॥ The _anuvritti_ of कित् and ङित् also is not here. Therefore, when this हि is treated as पित् (3.4.88), then too the substitution takes place, though a पित् _Sarvadhatuka_ is not ङित् (1.2.4). Thus शाधि is also found in the Vedas as having acute on the first syllable, which can only be when धि is पित् and consequently _anudatta_ (3.1.4)
