sutra: कृत्यल्युटो बहुलम्
vRtti: कृत्यसंज्ञकाः प्रत्यया ल्युट् च बहुलमर्थेषु भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes called '_kritya_' (111. 1. 95) and the affix '_lyut_', are diversely applicable and have other senses than those taught before.

The _anuvritti_ of the phrases 'when denoting action' and 'when the relation of the word formed to its parent verb is not that of an agent', which began with _sutras_ (3.3.18) and (3.3.19), does not extend to this _sutra_ or further. By saying 'diversely' we mean that they occur in other places than those where ordained by the rules. Thus the _kritya_ affixes are ordained to come when 'act' or 'object' is to be expressed, but they come also when the _karaka_ is other than the objective. Thus स्नानीयं चूर्णम् 'powder for bathing'; दानीयो ब्राह्मणः 'a _Brahmana_ to whom a donation is to be made'. In the first of these examples the 'powder' is the 'instrument' expressible by the 3rd. case, and in the second the '_Brahmana_' is the recipient expressible by the fourth case; so that in both cases the affix is applied without any express rule.

Similarly, ल्युट् is ordained to come in denoting instrument, location, and a verbal noun (3.3.115) and (3.3.117). But it is applied in other senses also. Thus राजभोजनाः शालयः 'halls for the eating of kings'; राजाच्छादनानि वासांसि 'dresses to be worn by the king'.

By using the word 'diversely', even the _krit_ affixes are applied in places other than those expressly ordained. Thus, पादाभ्याम् ह्रियते = पादहारकः । गले चोप्यते = गलेचोपकः । For accent see (6.2.150).
