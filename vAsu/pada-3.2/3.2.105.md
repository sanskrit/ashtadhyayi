sutra: छन्दसि लिट्
vRtti: छन्दसि विषये धातोर्लिट् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the _Chhandas_, the affix लिट् comes after a verb with a past signification.

As अहं सूर्यमुभयतो ददर्श 'I saw the sun from both sides'; अहं द्यावापृथिवी आततान 'I stretched the heaven and the earth'. Here the words ददर्श and आततान have the force of _nishtha_. See _Yaj_. _Ved_. (VIII. 9).

Why this separate _sutra_, when by aphorism (III.4.61), in the _Chhandas_ the _lun_, _lan_ and _lit_ come in all tenses ? That rule is made with regards to two or more verbs when in syntactical relation (धातुसम्बन्ध) with each other (III.4.1). The present rule is general, and without any such limitations.

_Lit_ is the affix of the Present Perfect and will be fully treated of in the conjugation of verbs.
