Thus कालिंमन्या, हरिणिंमन्या ॥ The augment मुम् does not prevent the shortening, had it done so, the rule would have been unnecessary. But दोषामन्यमहः, दिवामन्यारात्रिः, where दोषा and दिवा are Indeclinables there is no shortening. The above words are formed by खश् (3.2.83). The phrase _anavyayasya_ indicates by implication that the word खित् here means खिदन्तः, contrary to the maxim enunciated in (6.3.17) उत्तरपदाधिकारे प्रत्ययग्रहणे तदन्तविधिर्नेष्यते ॥ For an _Avyaya_ can never take a खित् affix which are ordained only after _dhatus_.
