sutra: हेरचङि
vRtti: हिनोतेर्हकारस्याभ्यासादुत्तरस्य कवर्गादेशो भवति अचङि ॥
vRtti_eng: "A guttural is substituted for the ह of हि (हिनोति) after a reduplication, but not in the Reduplicated Aorist."
---
As जिघीषति, प्र जेघीयते, प्रजिघाय; but प्राजीहयद् दूतम् in the simple Aorist. Objection: The word अचङि could be dispensed with from the _sutra_, in as much as चङ् can never come after the simple root हि, but after the causative of हि, and the causative stem of हि is a different verb than, हि. Answer: The fact of this word अचङि being employed in the _sutra_ indicates the existence of the following maxim: प्रकृतिग्रहणे ण्यधिकस्यापि ग्रहणम् "A radical denotes whenever it is employed in Grammar, not only that radical itself, but it denotes also whatever stem may result from the addition to it of the causative affix णि" ॥ Therefore we have प्रजिघाययिषति ॥

The word प्राजीहयत् is the Aorist of the causative of हि, with चङ्, the elision of णि, the shortening of the penultimate the reduplication, guttural change by कुहोश्चु, and lengthening by दीर्घोलघोः ॥
