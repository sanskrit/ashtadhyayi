sutra: सुप्प्रतिनामात्रार्थे
vRtti: नानार्थे वर्तमानेन प्रतिना सह सुबन्तं समस्यते अव्ययीभावश्च समासो भवति
E vRtti_eng: A word ending in a case-affix is compounded with the indeclinable word _prati_, when meaning a little and the compound is called _Avyayibháva_. 
---
The word नाना means a drop,' 'a little," "a wee bit;' as, शाकप्रति "a little of vegetable,' सूपप्रति 'a little of soup.’ 

Why do we say when meaning a little'? Observe वृक्षं प्रति विद्योतते विद्युत् 'it lightens in the direction of the tree.' Here it is not compounded. 

Though the word _sup_ was, by _anuvritti_  from _sútra_ 2, understood in this _sútra_, its repetition in the text is for the purpose of indicating that the _anuvritti_ of the word अव्यय which began with _sútra_  6 does not extend further into the subsequent _sútra_.

The word प्रतिना being exhibited in the 3rd case-affix is not an _upasarjana_ (l.2.43) and therefore, it comes as the last member of the compound (II.2.30).
