sutra: वयसि च
vRtti: वयसि गम्यमाने हरतेः कर्मण्युपपदेऽच्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अच् comes after the verb हृञ् when the object is in composition with it and when the meaning of the word to be formed is descriptive of age.
---
In this _sutra_ the verb हृञ् has the sense of _udyamana_ which was specifically excluded in the last. The word वयस् means the condition of human body as dependent upon time. This rule applies to those words which indicate the attainment of appropriate age for the accomplishment of objects described by the _upapada_, or the reaching of that age in which the thing described by the _upapada_ naturally takes place; as अस्थिहरः श्वा 'the dog that has reached the age when it can chew bones' (lit. when it can raise it up); कवचहरः क्षत्रियकुमारः 'the _Kshatriya_ boy old enough to wear (lit. 'to raise up or bear') the shield'; so that the verb here has the sense of 'raising up'.
