sutra: इच्छार्थेषु लिङ्लोटौ
vRtti: इच्छार्थेषु धातुषूपपदेषु धातोर्लिङ्लोटौ प्रत्ययौ भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes '_Lin_' and '_Lot_' are employed after a root; when another verb having the sense of 'wishing', is in construction with it.

This supersedes all other tense-affixes. When words expressing 'wish', such as इष्, कम्, प्राथ &c, are used, the Potential or Imperative is used; thus of इच्छामि कामये or प्रार्थये भुञ्जीत भवान् or भुङ्क्तां भवान् 'I wish, desire or pray that your honor may eat'.

Vart:- It is only when a desire is expressed that Potential or Imperative should be employed and not merely when the verb 'to wish' or its synonyms are in composition. Therefore the Potential or Imperative are not used here: इच्छन् करोति 'wishing, he does'.

The _sutra_ may be rendered thus: 'In connection with a verb in the sense of 'wishing' the Potential or the Imperative may be employed.
