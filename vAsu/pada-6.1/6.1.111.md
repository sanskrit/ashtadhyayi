sutra: ऋत उत्
vRtti: ङसिङसोरित्येव ऋकारान्तादुत्तरयोर्ङसिङसोरिति पूर्वपरयोरुकार एकादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the room of ऋ + अ of the case-affix अस् of the Ablative and Genitive singular, the single substitute is the letter short उ ॥

Thus होतृ + अस् = होतुर्स् (The उ must always be followed by र् (I. I. 51) though this उ is not the substitute of ऋ only, but of ऋ + अ conjointly: on the maxim that a substitute which replaces two, both shown in the genitive case, as ऋतः and अकारस्य in this _sutra_, gets the attributes of every one of these separately as the son C of a father A and mother B (though both conjointly produce him) may be called indifferently the son of A or the son of B. So the उ may be called the substitute of ऋ or अ) II The final स् is then elided by (VIII.2.24) and we have होतुर् = होतुः ॥ Thus होतुरागच्छति, होतुः स्वम् ॥
