वृत्तिः -- चङ्परे णौ यदङ्गं तस्य योऽभ्यासो लघुपरः, तस्य सनीव कार्यं स्याण्णावग्लोपेऽसति । The operations on a reduplicate (अभ्यासः) belonging to a अङ्गम् which is followed by the affix “णि” which itself is followed by the affix “चङ्”, are done as if the affix “सन्” follows, provided the following two conditions are satisfied – i) the vowel following the अभ्यासः is लघु (prosodically short) and ii) there is no elision (based on the affix “णि”) of a अक् letter.


Example continued from 6.1.11


च कमि + अ + त । Note: By 7.4.93 the operations on the अभ्यासः “च” are carried out as if the affix “सन्” follows the अङ्गम्।
