sutra: इच्छा
vRtti: इषेर्धातोः शः प्रत्ययो यागभावश्च निपात्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The form '_ichchha_' (desire) is irregular.

---
The word is thus formed : इष् + श = इच्छ् + अ = इच्छा. The यक् ordained by (3.1.67) is not added, this is the irregularity.

Vart:- The following words are also irregularly formed :- परिसर्या 'perambulation'; परिचर्या 'attendance, service'; मृगया 'hunting'; अटाट्य 'the habit of roaming about as a religious mendicant'.

Vart:- From the root जागृ we have either जागरा or जागर्या 'waking'. The first is formed by the affix अ, the latter by श which brings in यक् (3.1.67).
