sutra: दाशगोघ्नौ संप्रदाने
vRtti: दाशगोघ्नौ शब्दौ सम्प्रदाने कारके निपात्येते ॥
vRtti_eng: The words '_dasa_' and '_goghna_' are irregularly formed, and the affix in these denotes the idea of the Dative or Recipient.

---
The word दाश comes from the root दाशृ 'to give' by adding  affix अच् under rule (III.1.134). This being a कृदन्त word would have otherwise denoted the agent by rule (III.4.67) of this chapter. The present _sutra_ makes it denote the recipient or have the force of the dative case. Thus दाश means 'to whom something is given i. e. a servant'. Similarly _goghna_ does not mean 'the killer of cow' but 'he on whose coming the cow is killed in order to give him, that is to say, a guest'. It is this irregularly-formed word _goghna_ which is made applicable to the priests, guests, sons-in-law &c, and not the regularly-formed word _goghna_ which means 'a killer of cow' or a '_Chandal_'. Thus दाशः = दाशन्ति तस्मै; गोघ्नः = तस्मै दातुं गां घ्नन्ति ॥
