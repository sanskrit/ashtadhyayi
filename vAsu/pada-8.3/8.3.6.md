sutra: पुमः खय्यम्परे
vRtti: पुमित्येतस्य रुर्भवति अम्परे खयि परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: "रु is substituted for the म् of पुम्, (whereby the उ is changed to उँ or उं) before a surd mute (खय्) which is followed by a vowel, semivowel or a nasal (अम् _pratyahara_)."

Thus पुँस्कामा or पुंस्कामा; पुँस्पुत्रः or पुंस्पुत्रः; पुँस्फलं or पुंस्फलम्; पुँश्चली or पुंश्चली ॥ The _visarga_ in पुंस्कामा required to be changed optionally to ᳶ _jihva_-_muliya_ by (VIII. 3. 37), but it is not so done. It is changed always to स् here by (VIII. 3. 34), also. The स् of पुंस् is dropped by (VIII. 2. 23), and the preceding sound is म, which comes to light in forms like पुमान् &c. For the sake of distinctness, _Panini_ has elected to exhibit the shorter form पुम् when in the beginning of a composition : because this shorter form पुम् is the real stem in composition.  खय् _pratyahara_ includes the ten hard consonants, and अम् _pratyahara_ includes all vowels, semivowels and nasals. पुंस्कामा is formed by the affix ण = पुमांसं कामयते ॥

In that alternative when we read the preceding _sutra_ as समः स्सुटि, then the _anuvritti_ of this स् will be current in the present sutra_ also, and so there will be no scope for the operation of (VIII. 3. 37). And though the _anuvritti_ of रु is also current, yet it will not apply here, because of its non-appropriateness in that alternative.

Why do we say 'before a surd mute'? Observe पुंदासः, पुंगवः (V. 4. 92). Why do we say 'followed by a vowel or semivowel or nasal'? Observe पुंक्षीरः, पुंक्षुरः ॥ Why do we use the word परे in the _sutra_? Had we not used it, the _sutra_ might have been open to this construction also. The म् of पुम् is so changed before a खय् letter which has an अम् letter, (whether preceding it or following it). So that the rule would have applied to पुमाख्यः, पुमाचारः ॥
