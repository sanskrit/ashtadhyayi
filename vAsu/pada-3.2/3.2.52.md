sutra: लक्षणे जायापत्योष्टक्
vRtti: हन्तेर्जायापत्योः कर्मणोरुपपदयोर्लक्षणेवतिकर्तरि टक्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix टक् comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' when it is in composition with the word जाया 'wife' or पति 'husband' as object, and when the word so formed denotes the agent possessed of that attribute (or when the word so formed denotes a mark).

The word लक्षणा of this _sutra_ gives rise to the doubt whether it means लक्षणे कर्तरि or लक्षणवति कर्तरि. In the former case the meaning will be 'when the agent is itself the mark'; as जायाघ्नः 'a mole' (a mark on the body indicative of the death of one's wife). In the latter case the meaning will be 'when the agent is possessed of the attribute denoted by the word'; as जायाघ्नः 'the murderer of his wife'; पतिघ्नी 'the murderer of her husband'.

Of the affix टक् the letters ट् and क् are indicatory. The ट् shows that the feminine is formed by ई, and क् causing elision of the penultimate अ of हन्. Thus जाया + हन् + टक् = जाया + ह्न् + अ (6.4.98) = जायाघ्नः (7.3.54).
