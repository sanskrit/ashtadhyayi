sutra: दिक्पूर्वपदादसंज्ञायां ञः
vRtti: असंज्ञायामिति प्रकृतिविशेषणम् । दिपूर्वपदात्प्रातिपदिकादसंज्ञा विषयाद् ञः प्रत्ययो भवति शैषिकः ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix ञ comes in the remaining senses, after a word preceded by another that signifies 'direction', provided the compound is not a Name."
---
To a stem, whose first member is a word denoting direction, and which is not a Name, the affix ञ is added, forming the feminine in आ ॥ The word असंज्ञायाम् qualifies the 'base'. This debars अण् ॥ Thus पूर्वशाला + ञ = पौर्वशालः (VI. 4. 148), (VII. 2. 117) 'who is in the eastern hall'. Similarly दाक्षिणशालः, आपरशालः ॥

Why do we say "when not a Name"? Observe, from the word पूर्वेषुकामशमी (II. I. 50) we have पूर्वैषुकामशमः (VII. 3. 14), The example illustrates how first a compound of _Tatpurusha_ kind is formed by the words पुव + इषु-कामशामी; "_Ishukamshami_-in-the-East"; the whole being the name of the city. Then when the _Taddhita_ affix is added to this word, the first vowel is not _vriddhied_, as is the general rule (VII. 2. 117); but the first vowel of the second member of the compound is _vriddhied_, viz the letter इ of इषुकामशमी by rule (VII. 3. 14). Similarly अपरैषुकामशमः "who is in _Ishukamashami_-in-the-West".

The word 'पद' is used in the _sutra_ for the sake of percision, for had the _sutra_ been दिक्पूर्वादसंज्ञायां, there would rise the doubt, whether the the word-form दिक् was meant, or words denoting दिक् were meant. In fact the स्वरूपविधि is debarred by the use of the word ॥ For had it meant दिक्; the rule would have applied to words like दिग्गजः &c.
