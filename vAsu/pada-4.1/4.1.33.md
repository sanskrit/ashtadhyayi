sutra: पत्युर्नोयज्ञसंयोगे
vRtti: पतिशब्दस्य नकारादेशः स्त्रियां विधीयते ॥
vRtti_eng: The substitute न् replaces the final इ of पति before the feminine affix ङीप्, when the word so formed means \"a wife, who takes part in the sacrifices of her husband\".

Thus पत्नि वाचं यच्छ ॥ The feminine पत्नी means legitimate wife, she who is entitled to take part in the sacrifices of her husband. The word यज्ञसंयोग is an Instrumental _Tatpurusha_ compound and means "related through sacrifice" i. e who shares the fruits of and is entitled to participate in, the sacrifices of her husband. But when the sense is not that of 'wife', the feminine of पति will be पति as ग्रामस्य पतिरियं ब्राह्मणी 'this _Brahmani_ is the head or mistress of this village'. If the word पत्नी means 'the wife who takes part in the sacrifices of her husband', it cannot be applied to the wife of a _Sudra_, for a _Sudra_ cannot perform a sacrifice, a fortiori not his wife? The term पत्नी is, however, extended to the wife of a _Sudra_ also, by analogy, as the marriage of a _Sudra_ also takes place by offering sacrifice to Fire and making it a witness.
