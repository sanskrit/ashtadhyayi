sutra: तदस्मिन्नस्तीति देशे तन्नाम्नि
vRtti: तदिति प्रथमासमर्थादस्मिन्निति सप्तम्यर्थे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति, यत्प्रथमासमर्थमस्ति चेत्तद्भवति, यदस्मिन्निति निर्दिष्टं देशश्चेत्स तन्नामा भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: (An affix is placed after a word expressive of anything) in the sense of -- 'that thing is in this'--the place taking a name therefrom.

The words of this aphorism require a detailed examination. तद् 'that', i.e. the word in construction to which the affix is to be added must be in the nominative case. अस्मिन् "in this" -- this gives the meaning of the affix; अस्ति "is" this qualifies the sense of the base. इति is added merely for the sake of distinctness, serving the same purpose as quotation marks in modern writing. देशेतन्नाम्नि "a country having that name"; this qualifies the sense of the affix. The sense is:- "the affixes already taught or to be taught, come after a word being in the nominative case in construction, in the sense of the location, when the whole word so formed denotes the name of a country in which that thing exists".

This _sutra_ and the three subsequent _sutras_ are in fact one, though divided into four, for purposes of convenience. The affixes having the sense of these four _sutras_, are called चातुरर्थिक "quadruple significants".

Thus उदुम्बरा अस्मिन् देशे सन्ति = औदुम्बरः _Audumbara_--the country in which there are glomerous fig trees. Similarly बाल्बजः, पार्वतः &c. all these words are formed by the universal affix अण् (4.1.83).

This _sutra_ debars the अत्वर्थीय affixes.
