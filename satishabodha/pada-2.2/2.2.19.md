वृत्तिः -- उपपदं सुबन्तं समर्थेन नित्यं समस्यते। अतिङन्तश्चायं समासः। A सुबन्तम् (term ending in a सुँप् affix ) having the designation “उपपद” (ref: 3.1.92 तत्रोपपदं सप्तमीस्थम्‌) invariably compounds with a syntactically related term as long as the compound does not end in a तिङ् affix.


Example continued from 3.1.92


2.2.19 allows us to form a compound between “प्र” and “ज्ञ”।
