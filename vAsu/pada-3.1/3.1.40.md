sutra: कृञ्चानुप्रयुज्यते लिटि
vRtti: आम्प्रत्ययस्य पश्चात्कृञनुप्रयुज्यते लिटि परतः, कृञिति प्रत्याहारेण कृभ्वस्तयो गृह्यन्त तत्सामर्थ्यादस्तेर्भूभावो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After a verb which ends with आम्, the verb कृ 'to do' is annexed, when लिट् follows.

After the above verbs formed by taking the augment आम् the perfect tense of कृ is added to form their Perfect. This has already been illustrated in the above examples. The word कृ includes also the verbs भू and अस्. All these three may be used as auxiliaries. The verb अस् when used as an auxiliary, is not replaced by भू (III.4.52) before the लिट् affixes which are _ardhadhatuka_ affixes. Thus पाचयाञ्चकार, पाचयाम्बभूव, पाचयामास.
