sutra: नाभ्यस्तस्याचि पिति सार्वधातुके
vRtti: अभ्यस्तसंज्ञकस्याङ्गस्य लघूपधस्याजादौ पिति सार्वधातुके गुणो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _guna_ is not substituted for the penultimate light इक् vowel in the reduplicated form of a root, before a _Sarvadhatuka_ affix beginning with a vowel and having an indicatory प् ॥

As नेनिजानि, अनेनिजम्; परिवेविषाणि, पर्यवेविषम् ॥ Why of a reduplicated root? Observe वेदानि ॥ Why beginning with a vowel ? Observe नेनेक्ति ॥ The word पित् is read here for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_ like (VII.3.92). For here in cases other than पित्, _guna_ will be prevented by ङित् because of सार्वधातुकमपित् ॥ Why a _sarvadhatuka_ affix? Observe नेनेज in the Perfect, the affixes of which are _ardhadhatuka_ (III.4.115). Why do we say a penultimate light vowel? Observe जुहुवानि, अजुहवम् ॥

Vart:- There is diversity in the _Vedas_. As जुजोषत् the लेट् of जुस् ॥

The forms पश्पशात, चाकशीति, वावशीति, वावसीतीः are irregular. स्पश् + लेट् = स्पश् + आट् + ते = स्पश् + शप्श्लु+ आते = पस्पशाते ॥

The above forms are thus evolved. 1. ने निजानि is लोट् (Imperative Ist Person Singular), the मि is changed to नि, the augment आट् is added which is पित् (आडुत्तमस्य पिच्च (III.4.92)), श्लु is substituted for शप्, then there is reduplication, then _guna_ by (VII.4.75). 2. अनानजम् is लङ्, the मिप् is changed to अम् ॥ 3. ददानि is Ist Person Singular Imperative of विद् ॥ 4. ननाक्त is 3rd person singular of the Present. 5. निनज is the Perfect with णल् which is _ardhadhtuka_ (III.4.115). 6. जुजोषत् is the लट् of जुषी प्रीतिसेवनयोः (_Tudadi_ 8), in the _Parasmaipada_, the इ of तिप् is elided (III.4.97), then is added the augment अट् (III.4.94) then शप् is irregularly replaced by श्लु, then reduplication.

In the words पस्पशाते &c. the reduplicate has been shortened, as a Vedic form, in the Intensive यङ् लुक्॥ चाकशीत is from काशृदीप्तौ there is (यङ् लुक्, लट्, तिप्, and इट् augment by यङा वा (VII.3.94). वावशीतीः is from वाशृदीप्तौ, in the Intensive (यङलुक्), लट्, शत्, ङीप् and शस् i. e. it is the Accusative plural of the Feminine Present Participle from the Intensive root of वाश् ॥ The reading in the _Kasika_ is वावशीति ॥ In these two काश् and वाश् the roots have been shortened. Or the above forms may be derived regularly, without shortening, from the roots कश् and वश् ॥
