sutra: वह्यं करणम्
vRtti: वहेर्धातोः करणे यत्प्रत्ययो निपात्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The word वह्यं is irregularly formed, when the meaning of the word is an instrument of carrying.
---
The word वह्य is derived from root वह 'to carry' and means 'a vehicle', i. e., that by which a thing is carried; as वह्यं शकटम्. When it does not mean a carriage, the root takes the affix ण्यत्; thus वाह्यः 'an ox'.
