sutra: लिङाशिषि
vRtti: आशिषि विषये यो लिङ् स आर्द्धधातुकसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When the sense is that of Benediction, the substitutes of \"_lin_\" are called \"_ardhadhatuka_\", i. e. the personal endings of the Benedictive are \"_ardhadhatuka_\".

This debars these affixes from being called _sarvadhatuka_. Being _ardhadhatuka_ they take the augment इट्, and before these affixes the root does not take the _Vikaranas_ शप् &c. Thus from the root लू 'to cut', we have in the आशीर्लिङ्, लविसीष्ट; and from the root पू 'to purify', पविषीष्ट. But in the विधिलिङ् (Potential), we have the proper _Vikaranas_ &c. as लुनीयात्, पुनीयात् ।
