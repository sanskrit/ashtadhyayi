sutra: यजयाचयतविच्छप्रच्छरक्षो नङ्
vRtti: यजादिभ्यो धातुभ्यो नाङ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: After the verbs '_yaj_' (to worship), '_yach_' (to ask for), '_yat_' (to strive), '_vichchh_' (to shine), '_prachchh_' (to ask) and '_raksh_' (to preserve), comes the affix '_nan_' with the force of denoting mere action &c.

The conditions of _sutras_ 18 and 19 are understood here also. The ङ् of नङ् is for the sake of prohibiting _guna_ or _vriddhi_ (1.1.5); as यज्ञः 'sacrifice'; याच्ञा 'solicitation'; यत्नः 'effort'; विश्नः (6.4.19) 'lustre'; प्रश्नः 'a question'; रक्ष्णः 'protection.

 The root प्रच्छ, by (6.1.16), ought to have changed its र into ॠ before the ङित् affix नङ्. Its not doing so must be taken to be an irregularity countenanced by _Panini_, as we know from the fact that _Panini_ himself uses the form प्रश्नः in (III. 2. II7).
