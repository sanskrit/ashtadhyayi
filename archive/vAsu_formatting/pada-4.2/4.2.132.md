sutra: कोपधादण्
vRtti: ककारोपधात् प्रातिपदिकादण् प्रत्ययो भवति शैषिकः ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् comes in the remaining senses after a word denoting a place and having the letter क as its penultimate.

---
This debars वुञ्  in the case of words which denote जनपद or inhabited countries. Of course the words which do not denote जनपद, will have taken अण् even without this rule. Thus आर्षिकः "born in ऋषिकाः" So also माहिषिकः ॥

The affix अण् will apply even when the word ends in उ, and would have otherwise taken ठञ् by (4.2.119). Thus ऐक्ष्वाकः "born in इक्ष्वाकु" ॥ The word देशे is understood in this _sutra_.
