sutra: इतश्च
vRtti: ङिल्लकारसम्बन्धिन इकारस्य नित्यं लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And there is elision of the '_i_' of that _Parasmaipada_ affix which is the substitute of a '_la_' having an indicatory '_n_'.

Thus, for ति we have त्, for सि we have स्, &c, as in the above table. The इ of _Atmanepada_ is, however, not elided, because the _anuvritti_ of _Parasmaipada is understood here from _sutra_ (III.4.97). Thus अपचत्, अपाक्षीत्, but अपचावहि and अपचामहि।
