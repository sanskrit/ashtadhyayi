sutra: शि तुक्
vRtti: नकारस्य पदान्तस्य शकारे परतो वा तुगागमो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The augment त् may optionally be added to a word ending in न्, when a word beginning with श follows."
---
Thus भवाञ् च्छेते ॥ The augment is added to the end of the preceding word, and not to the beginning of the second word, in order to change श into छ ॥ In fact, the augment धुट् added to the second would have been as good as तुक्, namely both are त; but then छ change would not have taken place.

Objection:- If this be so, then why न् is not changed to ण्, since it is no longer final in a _pada_, when तुक् is added to it, in कुर्वञ् च्छेते ॥  

Answer:- This is to be thus explained. The _sutra_ स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः (VIII. 4. 40) should be divided into two parts, in order to prevent ण change. Thus the first part will be स्तोः श्चुना, which will mean that स and तु followed by श and चु will not cause the change of न to ण ॥ The next _sutra_ will be श्चुः, which will mean that the preceding  स and तु are changed to श and चु respectively.
