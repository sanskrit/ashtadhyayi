sutra: सनाद्यन्ता धातवः
vRtti: सनाद्यन्ताः समुदाया धातुसंज्ञा भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: All the words ending with the affixes सन् and others are called _Dhatu_.

This extends the sphere of _Dhatu_ or roots already defined in _sutra_ (I. 3. 1). These roots may be called derivative roots. They are separate independent roots, and have all the functions of a root, as taking tense-affixes &c. as shown in the above examples. Thus चिकीर्षा 'to wish to do', कारि 'to cause to do'; चेक्रिय 'to do repeatedly' are separate roots and not the same as कृ 'to do' and thus take शप् &c.
