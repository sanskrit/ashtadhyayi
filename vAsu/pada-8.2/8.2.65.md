As अगन्म, अगन्व the Imperfect of गम्, as in the sentence अगन्म तमसः पारम् ॥ The शप् is elided as a Vedic diversity. So also जगन्वान् with क्वसु, the augment इट् is not added by the option allowed, owing to (VII.1.68). This _sutra_ applies to those cases where the म is not at the end of a word, as it was in the last _sutra_.
