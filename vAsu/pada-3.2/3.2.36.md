sutra: असूर्यललाटयोर्दृशितपोः
vRtti: असूर्यललाट इत्येतयोः कर्मणोरुपपदयोः दृशितपोर्धात्वोः खश्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix खश् comes after the verb दृश् \"to see\" and तप् \"to heat\" when असूर्य and ललाट are the words in composition with them respectively as objects.

Thus असूर्य + दृश्  + खश् = असूर्यम्पश्यः; as असूर्यम्पश्या राजदारा 'the king's wives not even seeing the sun' (being shut up in the harem, and so having no opportunity of seeing the sun, that is, they are so well protected that even the sun cannot see them, much less any irreverent gaze).

So also ललाटन्तपः 'heating the fore-head' (such as the sun).

The word असूर्य is an incomplete or impossible compound, as the negative अ applies to the verb दृश् and not to the word सूर्य. This is in opposition to the rule of _samartha_ _pada_ _vidhi_ (II. I. 2).
