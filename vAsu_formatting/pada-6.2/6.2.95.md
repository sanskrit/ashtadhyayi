Thus वृद्ध꣡कुमारी 'an old maid'. The compounding is by (2.1.57). जर꣡त्कुमारी ॥ This compound is formed by (2.1.49) with जरती ॥ The words become masculine by (6.3.42) in both examples. Q. The word कुमारी was formed by ङीप् by (4.1.20) in denoting the prime of youth, how can this word be now applied to denote old age by being coupled with वृद्धा or जरती; it is a contradiction in terms. Ans; The word कुमारी has two senses; one denoting "a young maiden" and second "unmarried virgin". It is in the latter sense, that the attribute वृद्धा or जरती is applied. Why do we say "when the compound denotes age"? Observe परमकुमारी ॥
