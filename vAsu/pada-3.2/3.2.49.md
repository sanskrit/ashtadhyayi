sutra: आशिषि हनः
vRtti: आशिषि गम्यमानायां हन्तेर्धातोः कर्मण्युपपदे ड प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ड comes after the verb हन् 'to kill', when the object is in composition with it, and when benediction is intended.
---
The affix ड is understood in this _sutra_. Thus तिमिं वध्यात् = तिमिहः 'may he kill the whale'; शत्रुहः 'may he kill the enemy'.

Why do we say 'when benediction is intended'? Otherwise we have शत्रुघातः 'who kills his enemy'.

Vart:- The affix अण् comes after the verb आहन् when the word दारु 'wood' is in composition with it, and the final letter of the word so formed is changed into ट, when the word so formed denotes a name. As दारु आहन्ति = दार्वाघाटः (दारु + आहन् + अण्) 'the wood-pecker'.

Vart:- So also optionally when the word चारु 'beautiful' is in composition under the circumstances detailed in the last _vartika_: as चार्वाघाटः or चार्वाघातः ।

Vart:- So also, when the verb हन् is preceded by the preposition सम्, and is in composition with a word in the objective case, the affix अण् is employed; and the final is replaced by ट; as वर्णान् संहन्ति = वर्णसंघाटः or वर्णसंघातः 'the alphabet'; पदानि संहन्ति = पदसंघाट: or पदसंघातः 'connecting the words that are separated, an annotator'.
