sutra: सह सुपा
vRtti: सुपिति सहेति सुपेति च त्रयमप्यधिकृतम् वेदितव्यम्। यदित ऊर्ध्वम् अनुक्रमिष्यामस्तत्रेदमुपस्थितं द्रष्टव्यम्॥
vRtti_eng: The words '_saha supá_' meaning 'with a word ending in a case-affix,' are to be understood in each of the succeeding aphorisms.
---
In this aphorism the word ay is understood from _sutra_, so that it consists of three words vis, सुप्, सह, सुपा. All these three words jointly and severally, one at a time or two at a time, should be understood as governing the succeeding aphorisms, as the contingency of each _sutra_ may require. This aphorism will constantly be applied in translating the _sutras_ that follow.

Why have we used the word सह? Well, without it the _sútra_ would have stood thus: सह सुपा'a noun may be compounded with another noun.' But this overlooks the case of a compounding with a verb. The word is therefore used so that we may be able to break this composite _sútra_ into two separate and simple _sútras_, namely:-

(1). सह, सुप्, समस्यते समर्थेन' a case-ipflected word may be com. pounded with a word with which it is connected in sense. Here the word or with the help of the three words सुप् taken from _sútra_ 2, समस्यते from _sútra_ 3, and समर्थेन from _sútra_ i, forms one complete aphorism, and applies to compounds like अनुव्यचलत् अनुप्रावर्षत . The accent will depend upon these being considered as _samasa_. 

(2). सुपा सह समस्यते a case-inflected word is compounded with another sup-inflected word. The compound which does not fall within any of the various sorts of compounds to be treated of hereafter, will fall under this general head of compounds; as, पुनरुव्स्यूतं वासो  देवं पूनर्निष्ठतो स्थः.. This also is for the sake of accents.
