sutra: प्राक्कडारात्समासः
vRtti: कडारसंशब्दात् प्राग् यानित ऊर्ध्वमनुक्रमिष्यामस्ते समाससंज्ञा वेदितव्याः॥
vRtti_eng: From this point up to the aphorism _kadarakarmadháraye_ (II.2.38), all the terms that we shall say describe will get the designation of _samasa_ or compound.

Thus it will be stated. ‘The indeclinable word यया when not meaning like unto.' Here the word समास must be read into the sätra to complete the sense. • In fact this chapter and the second chapter treat of compounds and therefore the word compound must be read in all those aphorisms. 

The word _prák_ is employed for the same purpose as it was used in 1. 4. 56 that is to give the designation of समास to various technical terms like अव्ययीभाव &c. which otherwise would not have got the name of समास.
