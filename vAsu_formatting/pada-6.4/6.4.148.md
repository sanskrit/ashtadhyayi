sutra: यस्येति च
vRtti: इवर्णान्तस्यावर्णान्तस्य च भस्य ईकारे परे तद्धिते च लोपा भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The final इ and अ (both long and short), of a _bha_ stem, are elided before _Taddhita_ affix and before the feminine affix ई ॥

Thus दाक्षी, प्लाक्षी, सखी from दाक्षि, प्लाक्षि and सखि with the feminine affix ई (4.1.65) The above forms could also have been evolved by the simple rules of _sandhi_, as दाक्षि + ई = दाक्षी ॥ It might be asked, where was then the necessity of eliding इ? There would arise difficulty in the forms like अति सखि ॥  From the word सखी formed by ङीष् under (4.1.62), we form the compound सखीमतिक्रान्तः = अतिसखि, the final becoming short by (1.2.48) (the _samasanta_ affix टच् is not added here as required by (5.4.91), that rule applying to the masculine form सखि and not to the feminine सखी). Now if in forming सखि + ई = सखी, had we not elided the letter इ of खि, then the long  ई being the single substitute for both इ + ई, would be considered as like the final इ of सखि by (6.1.85). That being so, the word अतिसखि would be considered a non-घि word by (I .4. 7), for सखि has been specifically excluded form घि class. Not being a घि, we cannot have the form अतिसखेः in the Ablative and Genitive singular. Hence the necessity of eliding इ before the feminine ई, so that the _ekadesa_ rule (6.1.85), should not apply.

The short इ is elided before _Taddhita_ affixes:- दुलि – दौलेयः, वलि – वालेयः, अत्रि – आत्रेयः ॥ अ is elided before ई as :- कुमार – कुमारी, गौर – गौरी, शार्ङ्गरव – शार्ङ्गरवी ॥ अ and आ are elided before the _Taddhita_ :- दक्ष - दाक्षि, प्लक्ष – प्लाक्षिः, चूड – चौडिः, बलाका – बालाकिः, सुमित्रा – सौमित्रिः ॥

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of ई (शी), when it is the substitute of औ (7.1.18), being the case-affix of the nominative, and accusative dual in the neuter, and of certain feminine in long आ ॥ Before this ई, the preceding vowel, इ and अ are not elided. The stem before this ई is also _bha_ by (I .4.18) in the case of Neuter nouns. Thus काण्ड + ई = काण्डे; कुड्ये ॥ सौर्य + ई = सौर्ये (the य would have been elided by (6.4.149). It is owing to this _Vartika_, that we have inserted the word 'feminine' in the translation of the _sutra_. This may also be done by reading the _anuvritti_ of श्यां (6.4.136), and न (6.4.137) into this _sutra_.

Vart:- इयङ् and उवङ् are superseded, when they would apply simultaneously with this _lopa_. Thus इयङ् and उवङ् have unimpeded scope in श्री or भ्रू + औ or अस् (जस्), as श्रियौ, श्रियः, भ्रुवौ, भ्रुवः ॥ _Lopa_ has unimpeded scope in कमण्डलू – कामण्डलेयः (with ढञ् (4.1.135)), and भाद्रवाहेयः ॥ But in वत्सप्री + ढञ् (4.1.135), both the rules (6.4.77) and (6.4.148), present themselves. The former is superseded, and we have वात्सप्रेयः (वत्सं प्रीणाति = वत्सप्रीः, तस्यापत्यं); so also लैखाभ्रेयः with the ढक् affix, this word belonging to _Subhradi_ class (4.1.123).
