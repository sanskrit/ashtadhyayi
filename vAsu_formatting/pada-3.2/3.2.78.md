sutra: सुप्यजातौ णिनिस्ताच्छील्ये
vRtti: अजातिवाचिनि सुबन्त उपपदे ताच्छील्ये गम्यमाने धातोर्णिनिप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When habit is to be expressed, the affix णिनि comes after a verb, provided the word with a case-affix in composition with it, does not mean a genus.

Thus उष्ण + भुज् + णिनि = उष्णभोजिन्, 1st. sing. उष्णभोजी 'who eats his meal hot'. So also शीतभोजी &c.

Why do we say 'when it does not mean a genus'? Witness ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयिता 'the inviter of _Brahmanas_'. We cannot form ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयी

Why do we say 'when habit is to be expressed'? Witness उष्णं भुङ्क्ते कदाचित् 'he sometimes eats hot'.

Though the _anuvritti_ of the word '_supi_' was understood in this aphorism, its repetition here declares that _upasargas_ are not included. This is contested by the author of the _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_. According to him this affix comes even with _upasargas_. As अनुनायित्, अनुजीविन्, उपजीविन् &c.

Vart:- The verb आसृ in composition with the prepositions उत् or प्रति should be enumerated as taking this affix. As उदासारिन्, fem. उदासारिणी, 1st. plural उदासारिण्यः. So also प्रत्यासारिणी, pl. प्रत्यासारिण्यः ।

Vart:- So also when the sense is 'having skill in such and such action'. As साधुकारी 'excellent worker'; साधुदायी 'giving liberally'.

Vart:- So also after the verb वद preceded by ब्रह्म. As ब्रह्मवादिन्, in ब्रह्मवादिनो वदन्ति 'the knowers of _Brahma_ say'.
