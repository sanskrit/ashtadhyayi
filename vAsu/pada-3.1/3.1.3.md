This _sutra_ may also be treated as a _Paribhasha_ or an _Adhikara_ _sutra_. The _udatta_ accent falls on the affix, and if it consists of more than one vowel, then on the first of the vowels. Thus the affix तव्य has _udatta_ on the first अ as in कर्त्तव्यम्. This general rule of accent applies only where there is no special rule laid down. Thus, rule (VI. I.163), declares that affixes having an indicatory च will have _udatta_ on the final; those having an indicatory र have accent on the middle (VI.I.217); those that have an indicatory प are _anudatta_; those having an indicatory ज, throw the acute accent on the syllable immediately preceding the affix (VI.I.193); the affixes having an indicatory प्र and न throw the acute accent on the first syllable of the word to which they are added (VI.I.197); the _taddhita_ affix having an indicatory क  takes acute accent on the final (VI.I.165); and the affix having an indicatory त is _svarita_ (VI.I.185).
