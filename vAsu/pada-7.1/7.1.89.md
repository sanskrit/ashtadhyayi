sutra: पुंसोऽसुङ्
vRtti: पुंस इत्येतस्य सर्वनामस्थाने परतोऽसुङित्ययमादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: असुङ् (अस्) is substituted for the final of पुंस् in the strong cases.

---
The word पुंस् is derived from पा (to protect) + डुम्सुन् (_Unadi_ IV. 178), the म् being changed to _anusvara_. So when स् of पुंस् is replaced by अस् we get the form पुमस्, the उ of असुङ् indicates that न् should be added in the strong cases after अ (VII.1.70), so we have पुमान्, पुमांसौ, पुमांसः ॥

This substitution must take place in its incipient stage before the affixes are added, (उपदेशिवद्भावः) : otherwise the accent will be wrong. The compounds have acute on the final, (VI.1.223), therefore, परमपुंस् has acute on  पु. and in the Nominative Singular परमपुमान् the acute will remain on पु, but it is intended that it should be on मा, thus परमपुमान् ॥ The simple word पुमान् of course, has accent on पु ॥
