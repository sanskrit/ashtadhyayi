sutra: यासुट् परस्मैपदेषूदात्तो ङिच्च
vRtti: परस्मैपदविषयस्य लिङो यासुडागमो भवति सीयुटोऽपवादः सचोदात्तो भवति ङिच्च ॥
vRtti_eng: When the _Parasmaipada_ affixes of the Potential follow, then '_yasut_' acutely accented, is their augment, and the termination is regarded as having an indicatory '_n_'.

This debars सीयुट्; the उट् of यासुट् is indicatory; the real augment is यास्. All augments being _anudatta_, the present _sutra_ therefore especially uses the word _udatta_ to show that this augment is an exception to the general rule. Though लिङ् has an indicatory ङ्, and therefore by the rule (I. I. 56), its substitutes would also be regarded as having an indicatory ङ्, the repetition of the word ङित् in this _sutra_ shows the existence of the _paribhasha_ "that the ङ् belonging to ल does not influence its substitutes;" in other words, the substitutes of लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ् and लृङ् are not to be regarded as having an indicatory ङ् (लकाराश्रयङित्वमादेशानां न भवति). In the Potential, the स् of यासुट् is elided by (VII. 2. 79). So we get the forms कुर्यात्, कुर्याताम्, and by applying (III. 4. 108) and (VI. 1. 96), कुर्युस् । For the Benedictive लिङ् the following _sutra_ applies.
