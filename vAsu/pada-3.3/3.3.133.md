sutra: क्षिप्रवचने लृट्
vRtti: क्षिप्रवचन उपपदे आशंसायां गम्यमानायां धातोर्लृट् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When the word '_kshipra_' (quickly) or its synonym is in construction with the verb, the future affix, '_Lrit_' is employed after the root, when 'hope' is expressed in a conditional form.

This supersedes the last rule by which Aorist could also have been employed. By the present rule the Second Future can only be employed. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेत्क्षिप्रमागमिष्यति (or उपाध्यायश्चेदागतः--_Apte_.) क्षिप्रं व्याकरणमध्येष्यामहे 'if the teacher were to come soon, we shall soon learn grammar'.

By force of the word वचन in the aphorism, we take the synonyms of क्षिप्र also, such as शीघ्रं, आशु, त्वरितम्, &c. 

An objector might say, "the use of the word लृट् in the _sutra_ is redundant; for Future tense is the natural tense to be used, whenever hope is indicated. _Sutra_ (III. 3. 132) was merely an exception to this rule; so that the present _sutra_ re-enacting the general rule, ought to have been worded thus;-- न क्षिप्रवचने 'not so when a word expressing quickness is employed'; for such a rule debarring the past tenses given by (III. 3. 132), would have, of necessity, given scope to the Future tense which is the natural tense to express hope". To them we say, that there are two future tenses, लृट् and लुट् । By specifying लृट् we mean that लुट् should not be employed even where it would otherwise have come, such as in the following:- श्वः क्षिप्रमध्येष्यामहे 'to-morrow we shall learn soon'.
