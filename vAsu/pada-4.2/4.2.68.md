sutra: तेन निर्वृत्तम्
vRtti: तेनेवि तृतीयासमर्थान्निर्वृत्तमित्यस्मिन्विषये यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "After a word in the third case in construction, an affix is added, in the sense of 'completed by him', when the whole word so formed is the name of a country."

The phrase देशे तन्नाम्नि of the last _sutra_ governs this and the two subsequent _sutras_. By these four _sutras_ the names of countries are formed from various substantives. Thus कुशाम्बेन निर्वृत्ता = कौशाम्बी नगरी  "the city of _Kausambi_, completed by _Kusamba_". Similarly साहस्री परिखा "a mote completed by a thousand (gold coins) or persons". A place is named after the means or the person, by which or through whom it is established.
