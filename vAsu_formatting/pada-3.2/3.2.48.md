sutra: अन्तात्यन्ताध्वदूरपारसर्वानन्तेषु डः
vRtti: अन्त अत्यन्त अध्वन् दूर पार सर्व अनन्त इत्येतेषु कर्मसूपपदेषु गमेर्डप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ड comes after the verb गम् 'to go' when in composition with the following words as its objects:- अन्त 'end', अत्यन्त 'excessive', अध्वन् 'road', दूर 'far', पार 'across', सर्व 'all' and अनन्त 'endless'.

---
The _anuvritti_ of the word सञ्ज्ञायाम् does not extend to this. As अन्तगः 'having gone to the end, thoroughly conversant'; अत्यन्तगः 'going too fast'; अध्वगः 'a way-farer'; दूरगः 'going to a distant place'; पारगः 'completely familiar'; सर्वगः 'going everywhere, the Supreme Being'; अनन्तगः 'going to infinity, moving for ever'.

Of the affix ड the letter ड् is indicatory, the real affix being अ. The ड indicates that the टि portion of the word to which this is added, must be elided (6.4.143); as अन्त + गम् + ड = अन्त + ग् + अ (the टि portion अम् of गम् is elided). Now though the rule (6.4.143) says 'when that which has an indicatory ड, follows, there is elision of the टि of a भ'; yet in the present case, such elision takes place, although the word गम् here is not one of those called भ (l. 4. 18); because the presence of ड as an indicatory letter must not be unmeaning.

Vart:- The ड is also employed when the words in composition are सर्वत्र 'everywhere' and पन्न 'creeping'; as सर्वत्रगः 'Supreme Spirit'; पन्नगः 'snake.'

Vart:- So also when the word in composition is उरस् 'breast', and there is elision of its final. As उरस् + गम् + ड = उरगः 'moving on breast, a snake'.

Vart:- So also with the words सु 'well' and दुर् 'bad', when the resulting words denote location. As सुगः 'that in which one goes easily, easy of access'. दुर्गः 'difficult of access, a fort'.

Vart:- So also with the preposition निर्, the word to be formed meaning country; as निर्गः 'a country'.

Vart:- Others say, that this ड is added when other words besides the above stand as _upapadas_. Thus स्त्र्यगारगः (स्त्री + अगार + गम् + ड) 'who goes to the women's compartment'; ग्रामगः 'going to the village'; गुरुतल्पगः 'who pollutes the bed of his guru'.
