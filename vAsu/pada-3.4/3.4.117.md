sutra: छन्दस्युभयथा
vRtti: छन्दसि विषये उभयथा भवति सार्वधातुकमार्द्धधातुकं च ॥
vRtti_eng: In the Vedas this distinction of '_sarvadhatuka_' and '_ardhadhatuka_' is not always maintained, and the affixes are promiscuously employed.

In the Vedas, there is no hard and fast rule about _sarvadhatuka_ and  _ardhadhatuka_ affixes. Sometimes the तिङ् and शित् are treated as if they were _ardhadhatuka_. Thus वर्धन्तु त्वा सुष्टुतयः । Here the affixes of the लोट् are treated as _ardhadhatuka_ and consequently there is the elision of the णिच् by rule (VI. 4. 51); the proper form of this word would be वर्धयन्तु । Sometimes ardhadhatuka_ affixes are treated like _sarvadhatuka_ affixes; as विशृण्विरे; here the affixes of the लिट् are treated as _sarvadhatuka_ and so there is the _Vikarana_  श्नु and the उ is changed into व । Thus, वि + शृ + श्नु + इरे = वि + शृ + नु + इरे (III. 1. 74) = वि + शृ + न्व् + इरे (VI. 4. 87) = विशृण्विरे । Similarly, सुन्विरे । The लिङ् is sometimes treated in the Vedas both as _sarvadhatuka_ and _ardhadhatuka_ at one and the same time; as  उपस्थेयाम् शरणं बृहन्तम् । Here, by treating the affix as _sarvadhatuka_, there is elision of स in the लिङ् (VII. 2. 79) and by treating it again as _ardhadhatuka_, the आ of स्था is changed into ए । So also in स्वस्ति the affix is treated as _sarvadhatuka_ and there is no substitution of भू for अस् as required by (II. 4. 52).
