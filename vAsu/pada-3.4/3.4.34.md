sutra: निमूलसमूलयोः कषः
vRtti: निमूलसमूलशब्दयोः कर्मवाचिनोरुपपदयोः कषेर्द्धातोर्णमुल् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_namul_' comes after the verb '_kash_' (to rub), when the words '_nimula_' and '_samula_' are compounded with it in the accusative case.

Thus निमूलकाषं कषति 'he scrapes down to the roots'; समूलकाषं कषति 'he scrapes up to the roots'. In fact, the gerund of the root and the root itself denote the same thing; the whole sentence निमूलकाषंकषति being equal to निमूलं कषति. From this _sutra_ up to _sutra_ (III. 4. 46), the subsequent verb governing the previous word, must be derived from the same root from which the gerund is derived; see _sutra_ (III. 4. 46).
