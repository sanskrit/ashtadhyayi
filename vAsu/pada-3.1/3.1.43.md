sutra: च्लि लुङि
vRtti: धातोः च्लि प्रत्ययो भवति लुङि परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: When लुङ् follows, the affix च्लि is added to the verbal root.

The इ of च्लि is for the sake of articulation, the च is for the sake of accent (VI. I. 162.) showing that an affix which has an indicatory च has _udatta_ on its final. Then remains only लि, which after all, is to be replaced by other affixes, as we shall show below. In fact च्लि is the common name for all Aorist affixes.
