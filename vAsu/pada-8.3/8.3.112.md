Thus सेसिच्यते and अभिसेसिच्यते ॥

Question:- The स of the reduplicate should be changed into ष by (8.3.65), in अभिसेसिच्यते, and the स of the root should be changed into ष by (8.3.64). Because सिच् is one of the roots taught in (8.3.65), and therefore, as this latter rule prevents the operation of (8.3.111) i. e. पदादि स so far as it goes, so it would prevent also the operation of this rule and the form ought to be अभिषेषिच्यते ?

Answer:- The ष ordained by (8.3.65) prevents only the operation of पदादि स of (8.3.111), and the स of this rule. Therefore the present prohibition is of universal application.

Why do we say in the Intensive. Observe अभिषिषिक्षति ॥
