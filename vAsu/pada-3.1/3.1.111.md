sutra: ई च खनः
vRtti: खनेर्धातोः क्यप् प्रत्ययो भवतीकारश्चान्तादेशः
vRtti_eng: The affix क्यप् is employed after the root खन 'to dig', and long ई is substituted for the final of the root.

Thus खन् + क्यप् = ख + ई + य = खेयम् 'to be dug'. The long ई is used in the _sutra_ for the sake of euphony. The same purpose would have been served by using short इ, thus 'इ च खनः'. But the long ई indicates that the rule (VI. 4. 43) does not apply here. By that rule the अ of खन् would have been lengthened into आ before the affix क्यप्.
