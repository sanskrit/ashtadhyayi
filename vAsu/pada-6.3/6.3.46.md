sutra: आन्महतः समानाधिकरणजातीययोः
vRtti: समानाधिकरण उत्तरपदे जातीये च प्रत्यये परतो महत आकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: For the final of महत्, is substituted आत् (आ) before a word which is in apposition with it and before जातीय ॥

As महादेवः, महाब्राह्मणः, महाबाहुः, महाबलः, महाजातीयः ॥ But महतः पुत्रः = महत्पुत्रः "the son of the great man": the two words are not in apposition. The compounding with महत् takes place under (II. 1. 61). This rule applies to compounds under that rule, as well as to _Bahuvrihis_, when also the two words are in apposition, as in महाबाहुः ॥ In fact this is the object of using the word _samanadhikarana_ in this _sutra_. Had it not been used, then by the maxim of _pratipadokta_, the rule would have applied only to the _Tatpurusha_ compounds of _mahat_ taught under (II. I. 61) but not to _Bahuvrihis_. In महद्भूतश्चन्द्रमा = अमहान् महान् संपन्नः, the long आ is not substituted, as the sense of महत् is here secondary.

Vart:- आ is substituted for the final of महत् before घास, कर and विशिष्ट, the feminine महती being changed to masculine, though the words may not be in apposition. As महत्या घासः = महाघासः, महत्याः करः = महाकरः, महत्याविशिष्टः = महाविशिष्टः ॥

Vart:- आ is substituted for the final of अष्टन् before कपाल, when a sacrificial offering is meant. As अष्टाकपालं चरुं निर्वपेत ॥ Why do we say when meaning a sacrificial offering? Observe अष्टकपालं ब्राह्मणस्य ॥

Vart:- आ is substituted for the final of अष्टन् before गौ, when the meaning is that of 'yoked'. As, अष्टागवेन शकटेन ॥ But अष्टगवं ब्राह्मणस्य, where 'yoking' is not meant. The त् in आत् is for the sake of distinctness.
