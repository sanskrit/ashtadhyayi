sutra: एकगोपूर्वाट्ठञ् नित्यम्
vRtti: एकपूर्वाद्गोपूर्वाच्च प्रातिपदिकान्नित्यं ठञ् प्रत्ययो भवति मत्वर्थे ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _than_ (+-- इक) comes always in the sense of _matup_, after a stem, which in composition is preceded by एक or गो ॥

Thus एकशतमस्यास्ति = ऐकशतिकः; गौशतिकः, गौसहस्रिकः ॥

The word अतः of (5.2.115), is understood here also; so that, stems not ending in अ are not governed by this rule, such as एकविंशतिरस्यास्ति, no affixing. The word ऐकगविकः is an apparent exception, it being formed by adding ठञ् to the _samasanta_ word एकगव (5.4.92). How do you explain गौशकटिकः formed by ठञ् from गोशकटी ? Here शकटं is taken for शकटी, both being synonyms (N. B. This opinion of the _Kasika_-author is not in harmony with that of _Patanjali_, who does not read the _anuvritti_ of अतः into this _sutra_. According to him गौशकटिक is formed from गोशकटी; and एकविंशति &c, do not take this affix, because it is against usage. But the author of _Kasika_ says—अवश्यं चात इत्यनुवर्त्यम्; द्वन्द्वापतोपगर्ह्यात् इत्येवमाद्यर्थम् -- the _anuvritti_ of अतः must surely be read, for the sake of _sutras_ like (5.2.128), though in the _sutras_, like वातातिसाराभ्यां &c there is no necessity of reading the _anuvritti_ of अतः) ॥

The word नित्यम् 'always', is used in the _sutra_ to indicate that मतुप् does not come in the alternative. In all the previous _sutras_ मतुप् came in the alternative. How do you form एकद्रव्यवत् in एकद्रव्यवत्वाद् ? This is not a correct form; or it may be said to be a compound of एक and द्रव्यवत्वात् ॥
