Thus कुमार꣡कुलटा, कुमार꣡श्रमणा, कुमार꣡तापसी ॥ The word कुमार꣡ has acute on the final as it is derived from the root कुमार क्रीडायाम् with the affix अच् of पचादि ॥ By (II. 1. 70), it is ordained that कुमार is compounded with श्रमण &c. Some commentators hold that the word कुमार must be followed by श्रमण &c. (II. 1. 70) to make this rule applicable. They refer to the maxim लक्षणप्रतिपदोक्तयोः प्रतिपदोक्तस्यैव ग्रहणम् "whenever a term is employed which might denote both something original and also something else resulting from a rule of grammar, or when a term is employed in a rule which might denote both something formed by another rule in which the same individual term has been employed, and also something else formed by a general rule, such a term should be taken to denote, in the former case, only that which is original, and in the latter case, only that which is formed by that rule in which the same individual term has been employed." Other Grammarians, however do not make any such limitation, but apply the rule to all _Karmadharaya_ compounds of कुमार ॥
