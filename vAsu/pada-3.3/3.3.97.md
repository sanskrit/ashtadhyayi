sutra: ऊतियूतिजूतिसातिहेतिकीर्त्तयश्च
vRtti: उत्यादयः शब्दा निपात्यन्ते ॥
vRtti_eng: And these words viz. \"_uti_\" (preserving sport), \"_yuti_\" (joining), \"_juti_\" (velocity), \"_sati_\", (destruction), \"_heti_\" (a weapon) and \"_kirti_\" (fame) are anomalous forms, acutely accented.

The _anuvritti_ of the word मन्त्रे does not exist in this; but the word उदात्त of the last syllable is understood here. The word ऊति is thus formed :- अव् 'to protect' + क्तिन् = ऊ + तिः (VI. 4. 20) = ऊतिः । this form is regular and could be evolved from _sutra_ 94 also; but not so the accent. The irregularity in पूतिः and जूतिः consists in the lengthening of उ into ऊ; in सातिः the आ of the root सै which becomes सा by (VI. I 45), is not changed into इ, as rule (VII. 4. 40) required, and this is the irregularity. This form may also be derived from the root सन् with perfect propriety, except as to the accent which would be regulated by the present _sutra_: thus सन् + क्तिन् = सा + क्तिन् (VI. 4. 42) साति. The form हेति may by derived either from हन् or हिनोति ।
