sutra: क्रियासमभिहारे लोट् लोटो हिस्वौ वा चतध्वमोः

vRtti_eng: When the (frequency or) repetition of an action is indicated, the affx '_Lot_' is added to the root, and the verb is repeated. And the affixes '_hi_' and '_sva_', or the affixes '_ta_' and '_dhvam_' are the substitutes of '_Lot_'.

Professor Bohtlingk translates this as follows: "When the repetition of an action is expressed, the Imperative is used, and though the second person singular is used, it may also stand for the second person plural."

The phrase धातुसंबन्ध of the last _sutra_ is understood here also. The frequency or repetition of an action is called समभिहारः । This word qualifies the sense of the original. In other words, "when the sense of frequency &c, is understood in connection with the action, this sense not being included in that of the verb, as it may be in the case of a verb from frequentative roots."

This Imperative mood is employed in all Tenses and Persons in connection with all moods. But this peculiar use of the Imperative is confined to the 2nd. person singular and plural _Parasmaipada_ (हि and त); and 2nd. person singular and plural _Atmanepada_ (स्व and ध्वम्). In other words, “the Imperative second person (_Parasmaipada_ and _Atmanepada_) is repeated, though the subject of the main verb be different and the verb be in any tense." Thus लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं लुनाति 'he cuts repeatedly', as if some one was always calling out to him 'cut thou, cut thou'. लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येव इमौ लुनीतः or इमे लुनन्ति 'they cut often and often'. So also लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येव त्वं लुनासि, युवाम् लुनीथः or यूयं लुनीथ 'thou or you two or you all cut repeatedly' as if some one was calling out to you 'cut you, cut you'.

So also लुनीत लुनीतेत्येव यूयं लुनीथ, अहं लुनामि, अयमलावीत् &c. 'you cut, I cut, he has cut repeatedly', as if some one was calling out to us 'cut ye, cut ye'. Similarly with _Atmanepada_ roots; as अधीष्वाधीष्वेत्येवायमधीते, इमौ अधीयाते, इमे अधीयते &c. 'he or they study hard' as if some one was calling out to them 'study thou, study thou'.

So also अधीष्वमधीष्वमित्येव यूयमधीध्वे &c. Similarly in every tense, mood and person; as, अधीष्वाधीष्वेत्येवाहमधीये, आवामधीवहे, वयमधीमहे ।

The Intensive verbs in यङ् also have this meaning of frequency, but there the verb is not repeated, as the sense of frequency there is inherent in the verb; in this case we must repeat the verb to express frequency. See (VIII. 1. 4).

This use of the Imperative is not found in Literature (Bohtlingk), but in _Marathi_.
