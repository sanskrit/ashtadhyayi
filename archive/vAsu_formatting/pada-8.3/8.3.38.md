sutra: सोपदादौ
vRtti: सकार आदेशो भवति विसर्जनीयस्य कुप्वोरपदाद्योः परतः पाशकल्पककाम्येषु ॥
vRtti_eng: स is the substitute of a _visarga_ before an affix beginning with a hard guttural or labial.

---
The word अपदादौ means "when the guttural and labial are not at the beginning of a word," in other words, when they stand at the beginning of an affix. This is possible only before the affixes पाश, कल्प, क, and काम्य ॥ Thus पयस्पाशम् (5.3.47); पयस्कल्पम्, यशस्कल्पम्, (5.3.67), पयस्कं, यशस्कम्, (5.3.70); पयस्काम्यति, यशस्काम्यति (3.1.9).

Why do we say 'when not at the beginning of a word'? Observe पयᳶ कामयते, पयᳶ पिबति ॥

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated, when the _visarga_ belongs to an Indeclinable: as, प्रातः कल्पम्, पुनः कल्पम् ॥

Vart:- The _visarga_ which comes from रु is only changed to स before काम्य, and not any other _visarga_. As पयस्काम्यात, and यशस्काम्यति; but not here, गीः काम्यति धूः काम्यति ॥

Vart:- स is the substitute of the _Upadhmaniya_ when followed by a guttural. The root उᳶज् (आजवे _Tudadi_ 20) has _Upadhmaniya_ as its penultimate: though it is written in the _Dhatupatha_ as उव्ज the व् only represents the प् of ᳶप, and is not to be pronounced. This ᳶप is changed to स, when the final ज् is changed to a guttural, as उ स ग, and then this स् is changed to द्, as in अभ्युद्गः, समुद्गः ॥

These words, however, may be derived from the root गम with the Prepositions अभि, उत्, and सम् उत्, by adding the affix उ ॥
