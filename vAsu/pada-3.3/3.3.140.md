sutra: भूते च
vRtti: भूते च काले लिङ् निमित्ते क्रियातिपत्तौ सत्याम् लृङ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: And (where there is a reason for affixing '_Lin_', the affix '_Lrin_' is to be employed, when the non-completion of the action is to be understood) if the sense is that of past time.

The whole of the last aphorism is understood in this. The last _sutra_ enjoined लृङ् in the Future tense; this _sutra_ ordains it in the Past, the Conditional tense having both these significations. The reasons for affixing लिङ् are given in _sutras_ (3.3.152) and those that follow it. In _sutra_ (3.3.141) and those that follow, as far as (3.3.152), optional rules for the employment of the Conditional tense will be given. Thus:- दृष्टो मया भवत्पुत्रोऽन्नार्थी चङ्क्रम्यमाणः अपरश्च द्विजो ब्राह्मणार्थी, यदि स तेन दृष्टोऽभविष्यत्, तदाऽभोक्ष्यत, न तु भुक्तवान्, अन्येन पथा स गतः । 'I saw your son, wandering about in search of food, I saw also a twice-born in search of a _Brahmana_(whom he would feast); if he (your son) had been seen by him (the twice-born), then he would have been fed; but as a matter of fact, he has not been fed, he went by a different road'.

The conditional sentence यदि स तेन दृष्टोऽभविष्यत् तदाऽभोक्ष्यत is employed under circumstances set out above. It refers to a past time, there is the relation of cause and effect existing, one being in search of food, and another in search of a guest to feed; and the action is not completed; both taking different roads, did not come across each other.
