sutra: अचो यत्
vRtti: अजन्ताद्धातोर्यत्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix यत् comes after a root that ends in a vowel.
---

The letter त् of this affix is indicatory showing that the _udatta_ accent falls on the first vowel (VI. I. 213); thus गा + यत् = गेय, noun sing. गेयम् 'what is to be sung'; so also पेयम् 'what is to be drunk'; जेयम् 'what is to be conquered'. The आ of गा and पा is changed into ए by (VI. 4. 65). Why do we say 'that ends in a vowel'? By _sutra_ 124 of this chapter, a root ending in a consonant takes ण्यत् affix instead of यत्; reading these two aphorisms together, the conclusion to be drawn is that the affix यत् comes after roots which primarily end in a vowel, though in the course of development they may end in a consonant by the application of other rules. Thus from दो 'to cut', we have the desiderative root दित्स, which ends in a vowel अ. This अ is elided before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes and thus the root becomes दित्स्, which ends in a consonant; nevertheless we shall have the affix यत् and not ण्यत्. Thus दित्स्यम् 'what is wished to be cut'; धित्स्यम् 'what is wished to be placed'. Similarly लु before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes becomes लो, the ओ is changed into अव् before य (VI. I. 79) and the form then is लव्. The root लव् however takes यत् and not ण्यत्; as लव्यो, पव्यम्, &c.

Vart:- The verbs तक् 'to fly', शच् 'to leap', चत् 'to ask', यत् 'to attempt' and जन् 'to be born', should be enumerated in addition; that is to say, these verbs, though ending in a consonant, take यत् and not ण्यत्; as तक्यम्, शस्यम्, चत्यम्, यत्यम्, and जन्यम्.

Vart:-Ånd of the verb हन् 'to kill' वध is the substitute when it optionally takes the affix यत्. Thus we have वध्यम् or घात्यम्. The latter form is evolved by _sutras_ (VII. 3. 32 and 54). The affix यत् comes only after the वध् substitute; after हन् the affix ण्यत् comes which changes the ह into घ, and न into त and causes _vriddhi_.
