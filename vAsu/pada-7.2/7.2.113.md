sutra: हलि लोपः
vRtti: हलादौ विभक्तौ परत इदमोऽककारस्य इद्रूपस्य लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The इद् of इदम् is elided before a case-affix beginning with a consonant.

As आभ्याम्, एभिः, (7.1.11) एभ्यः एषाम्, एषु ॥ For म् is substituted अ by (7.2.102), and for अ + अ = अ by (6.1.97). The rule: (1.1.52) by which a substitute replaces only the final letter, does not apply here, on the maxim मानर्थके अलोऽन्त्यविधिः ॥ For no purpose is served by eliding merely the final म् of इदम् ॥ Hence इद् is elided. Or it may be said that the _sutra_ does not teach the elision of इद्, but of अन् which was substituted for इद् by the preceding _sutra_.
