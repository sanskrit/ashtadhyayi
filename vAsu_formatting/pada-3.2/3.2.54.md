sutra: शक्तौ हस्तिकपा(वा)टयोः
vRtti: शक्तौ गम्यमानायां हस्तिकपा(वा)टयोः कर्मणोरुपपदयोर्हन्तेटक्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix टक् comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' when the word in composition with it as its object is हस्ती 'elephant' or कपाट 'gate' and when the sense indicated is that of power.

This _sutra_ applies where the agent is a human being. As हस्तिनं हन्तुं शक्तः = हस्तिघ्नः मनुष्यः 'a man who is strong enough to kill an elephant'; so also कपाटघ्नः 'a burglar' (who is capable of breaking open the doors).
 
Why do we say 'where power is indicated'? Observe विषेण हस्तिनं हन्ति = हस्तिघातः 'who kills the elephant by poison'. Here the affix is अण्.
