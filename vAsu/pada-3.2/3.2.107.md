As जक्षिवस् 1st. sing. जक्षिवान् 'eaten' (_Yaj_. (VIII. 19)); पपिवस् 1st. sing. पपिवान् 'drunk'.

Sometimes it does not come, as in the example under _sutra_ (III. 2. 105); अहं सूर्यमुभयतो ददर्श.

The division of this _sutra_ from the last, in which it could well have been included, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_, into which the _anuvritti_ of क्वसु only runs.
