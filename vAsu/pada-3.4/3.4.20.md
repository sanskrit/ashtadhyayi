sutra: परावरयोगे च
vRtti: परेण पूर्वस्य योगे गम्यमाने अवरेण च परस्य धातोः क्त्वा प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ktya_' is added to a root, to denote what is situate on that (_para_) side or on this (_avara_) side of something.

The situation on the पर 'the other side' and अवर 'this' side, is called परावरयोगः । Thus अप्राप्य नदीम् पर्वतः स्थितः 'the mountain is situate without having reached the river i. e. on this side of the river, the river being on the other side. Here the word पर्वत is qualified by the word नदी which is the point from which the situation is taken; and which in this case, is on the other side of the mountain. Similarly अतिक्रम्य तु पर्वतं नदी स्थिता 'the river is situate on the other side of the mountain'. Here the relation between the 'mountain' and the 'river' is of अवर and पर ।

In other words:- "The gerund of a root may be used to imply the situation of a thing with reference to the situation of another spoken of as the agent of the action denoted by that root and of the action denoted by another verb or primitive word used along with the gerund; though the action referred to in the gerund is not prior to the other action"--G. P.
