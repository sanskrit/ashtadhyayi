sutra: न यद्यनाकाङ्क्षे
vRtti: यच्छब्दउपपदे धातोः क्त्वाणमुलौ प्रत्ययौ न भवतोऽनाकांक्षे वाक्ये ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes '_ktva_' and '_namul_' are not added to a root, when the word '_yad_' is used, in a simple sentence, which does not depend upon another to complete the sense.

The word आकांक्षा means 'inter-dependence' or the inability of a word, phrase or sentence, to indicate the intended sense in the absence of another word, phrase, or sentence. In other words, when there are two actions one prior and another subsequent, and they complete the sense of the sentence, without standing in need of any other verb; in such a case, _ktva_ and _namul_ are not used, when the word _yad_ is in composition. This _sutra_ prohibits the affix _ktva_ also, though the affix _namul_ is in immediate context. Thus यदयं भुङ्क्ते ततः पचति, यदयमधीते ततः शेते, 'having eaten, he cooks ; having read, he sleeps'.

But when there is inter-dependence or आकांक्षा, we have यदयं भुक्त्वा व्रजति, अधीत एव ततः परम् । Professor Bohtlingk translates it thus : "In connection with यद् the above-mentioned Absolutives will not be applied, unless the two verbs required one more as complement."
