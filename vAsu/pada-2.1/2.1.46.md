sutra: तत्र
vRtti: तत्रेत्येतत् सप्तम्यन्तं क्तान्तेन सह समस्यते, तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word _tatra_ ‘there,' which is a word ending with the 7th case-affix, (V. 3. 10) is compounded with a word ending in _kta_, and the resulting compound is _Tat-purusha_.

Thus तत्रभुक्तम् ‘eaten there.' तत्रकृतं 'done there,’ तत्रपीतं 'drunk there.' By making this a compound, the same purpose is served as in _sútra_ (II. 1. 25) namely, these two words form one word and get one accent.
