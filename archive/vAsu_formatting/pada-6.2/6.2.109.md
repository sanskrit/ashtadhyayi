Thus गार्गी꣡बन्धुः, वात्सी꣡बन्धुः ॥ The words गा꣡र्गी and वा꣡त्सी are formed by adding ङीष् (4.1.16) to गार्ग्य and वात्स्य ending in यञ् (4.1.105), and therefore, they are first acute. By (6.2.1) this accent would have been retained, but for the present _sutra_. Why do we say "a _Nadi_ (Feminine in ई) word"? Observe ब्र꣡ह्मबन्धुः, the word ब्रह्म has acute on the first syllable as it is formed by मनिन् (_Unadi_ IV. 146) and it retains that accent (6.2.1). Why do we say "before बन्धु"? Observe गा꣡र्गीप्रियः ॥
