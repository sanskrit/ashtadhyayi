वृत्तिः -- इडादौ सिचि हलन्तस्य वृद्धिर्न। A vowel belonging to a base (अङ्गम्) ending in a consonant does not take the वृद्धि: substitute when followed by the affix सिँच् which has the augment इट्।


Example continued from 7.2.3


पठ् + इस् + ईत् 7.2.4 stops the वृद्धि: substitute which would have been done by 7.2.3. Now 7.2.7 prescribes an optional वृद्धि: substitute.


Example continued under 7.2.7.
