These words are irregularly formed by the affix घ with the same force as in the last aphorism. This is an _apavada_ or exception to rule (III. 3. 121), by which after roots ending in consonants, the affix घञ् is added. Thus गोचरः 'pasturage', (lit. that in which the cows graze); सञ्चरः 'a passage', (lit. through which they move ); वहः 'a vehicle' (lit. by which men are carried); व्रजः 'a cow-pen' (by which they go); व्यजः 'a fan' (by which they move the air); the anomaly in this consists in not replacing the अज् of व्यज् (वि + अज्) by the substitute वी as required by _sutra_ (II. 4. 56); आपण 'a market' (lit. that in which men come and traffic); निगमः 'the _Veda_', 'a market' (that into which they enter).

The force of the word च in the aphorism is to include other words also, which have not been already mentioned. Thus कषः, निकषः 'a touch-stone', (lit. that on which they rub).
