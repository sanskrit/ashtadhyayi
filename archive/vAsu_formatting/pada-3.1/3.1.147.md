sutra: ण्युट् च
vRtti: गायते र्ण्युट् प्रत्ययो भवति शिल्पिनि कर्त्तरि
vRtti_eng: The affix ण्युट् is also employed after the verb गै 'to sing', when the agent so expressed denotes an; artist.

By the word च 'also', the word गा of the last _sutra_ is drawn into this. Thus गै + ण्युट् = गा + अन (VII. I. I) = गायनः fem. गायनी; the य is added by (7.3.33).

The separation of these rules (_yoga_-_vibhaga_ ) relating to गै is for the purpose of the _sutras_ that follow. Had गस्थकन् and ण्युट् च been made one aphorism, the _anuvritti_ of both these affixes would have run into the subsequent _sutras_. But it is intended that the _anuvritti_ of ण्युट् should only run, and hence this _yoga_-_vibhaga_ or division of one _sutra_ into two.
