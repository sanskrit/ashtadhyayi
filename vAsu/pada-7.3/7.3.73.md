sutra: लुग्वा दुहदिहलिहगुहामात्मनेपदे दन्त्ये
vRtti: दुह दिह लिह गुह इत्येतेषामात्मनेपदे दन्त्यादौ परतः क्सस्य वा लुग्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The whole of the affix क्स is elided optionally before the personal endings of the _Atmanepada_ beginning with a dental, after दुह्, दिह् लिह् and गुह् ॥

---
As अदुग्ध or अधुक्षत, अदुग्धा or अधुक्षथाः, अदुग्ध्वम् or अधुक्षध्वम्, अदुह्वहि or अधुक्षावहि, अदिग्ध or अधिक्षत, अलीढ or अलिक्षत, न्यगुढ or न्यधुक्षत ॥

Why दुह् &c. only? Observe व्यत्यरुक्षत ॥ Why in the _Atmanepada_? Observe अधुक्षत only. Why before an affix beginning with a dental? Observe अधुक्षामहि only. Though the _anuvritti_ of लोप was understood in this _sutra_; the employment of the term लुक् indicates that the whole of the affix is to be elided. For लोप would have elided only the final अ of स ॥ But even with the elision of अ alone we would have got all the above forms, except those in वहि ॥ For अ being elided, we have स् between ह् (a consonant of झल् class) and a dental (which is also a letter of झल् class). This स् situate between two झल् will be elided by (VIII.2.26). Nor can it be objected that the elided अ is _sthanivat_, for by पूर्वत्रासिद्धं (VIII.2.1), such an elision cannot be _sthanivat_. Though व् is a dento-labial, yet it is included in the word dental. Had it not been meant to be so included, तौ (letters of त class) would have been taken in the _sutra_. See (III. I. 45), for this Aorist-affix.
