This supersedes the First Future. The separation of this aphorism from the previous one, is for the sake of the rules that follow. The rule (1. 3. 10) does not also apply here. Thus यच्च यत्र वा त्वमेवं कुर्याः न श्रद्दधे, न मर्षयामि 'I do not think, nor can I tolerate that thou wilt do so'.
 
The Conditional (लृङ्) will also be employed under its own proper conditions as shown in the last aphorism.
