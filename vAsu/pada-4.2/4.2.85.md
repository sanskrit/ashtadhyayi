vRtti_eng: The affix मतुप् is added in denoting a river.

---
When the name of a river is to be designated by something which is found near it, we add the affix मतुप् (मत् and वत्). Thus उदुम्बरा꣡वती, मशका꣡वती, वीरणा꣡वती, पुष्करा꣡वती, इक्षु꣡मती, द्रु꣡मती ॥ See (6.3.119) by which the अ is lengthened in these words, and (6.1.219) by which the _udatta_ is placed on this vowel. See (8.2.10) by which मत् becomes वत् ॥

The affix मतुप् is not however employed in forming the river-names भागीरथी and भैमरथी, which are formed by अण् added under (4.2.68).
