sutra: न सामिवचने
vRtti: सामिवचने उपपदे क्तान्तात्कन्प्रत्ययो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Not so when a word in the sense of 'half', precedes such participle.

---
When the word सामि or any other word having this sense, is compounded with a participle in क्त, the affix कन् is not added to denote the sense of incompleteness. Thus सामिकृतम्, सामिभुक्तम् &c (2.1.27). The word वचन shows that the synonyms of सामि are also to be taken. Thus अर्द्धकृतम्, नेमकृतम् &c.

Objection:-- It is redundant to have prohibited कन् after a word preceded by 'half', because the word "half" itself shows that the action has not been completed.

Answer:-- The prohibition contained in this _sutra_ does not refer to the कन् of the last _sutra_, where it has the sense of "incompleteness". It refers to that कन् which comes after a word, without changing the sense of that word (स्वार्थे कन्) ॥ Thus the words भिन्नतर and भिन्नतम (the comparative and superlative degrees of भिन्न) show by the very fact of their comparison, that the action denoted by them is not complete. These words भिन्नतर and भिन्नतम also take the affix कन् without change of sense. As भिन्नतरकः and भिम्मतमकः ॥ and बहुतरकं &c as used by _Patanjali_ himself in the following sentences:-- एवं हि सूत्रमभिन्नतरकं भवति, एतैर्हि बहुतरकं व्याप्यते ॥ This कन् is also prohibited in the case of compounds with सामि ॥ In fact, this _sutra_ teaches by implication _Jnapaka_) that कन् comes also in the sense of _svartha_.
