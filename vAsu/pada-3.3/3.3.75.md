sutra: भावेऽनुपसर्गस्य
vRtti: अनुपसर्गस्य ह्वयतेः संप्रसारणमप्प्रत्ययो भवति भावेऽभिधेये ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix \"_ap_\" comes after the verb \"_hve_\" and there is the change of the semi-vowel to its corresponding vowel, when the root is _upasarga_-less, and mere action is denoted.

As हवः 'calling'; हवे हवे सुहवं शूरमिन्द्रम् ।

Why do we say 'when no _upasarga_ is in composition with it'? Observe आह्वायः । Though the _anuvritti_ of the word भाव was understood in this aphorism from _sutra_ 18, its repetition here shows that the _anuvritti_ of _sutra_ 19. which was running, must not be taken; so that this word applies to agent-_karaka_ also.
