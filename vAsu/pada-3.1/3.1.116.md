sutra: पुष्यसिद्ध्यौ नक्षत्रे
vRtti: पुषे सिधेश्चाधिकरणे क्यप् निपात्यते नक्षत्रेऽभिधेये ॥
vRtti_eng: The words पुष्य and सिद्ध्य are irregularly formed by the affix क्यप्, when used as names of asterisms.

---
Thus पुष् + क्यप् = पुष्यः 'the _Pushya_ asterism'. It is so called because objects are nourished under the influences of this asterism. सिध् + क्यप् = सिद्ध्यः 'the asterism _Siddhya_' another name of _Pushya_, so-called because things are accomplished under the influence of this star.

When not the names of asterisms, the forms are पोषणं 'nourishing', सेधनम् 'accomplishing'.
