sutra: स्तम्बकर्णयोः रमिजपोः
vRtti: स्तम्बकर्ण इत्येतयोः सुबन्तयोरुपपदयोर्यथासंख्यं रमिजपोर्धात्वोरच्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अच् comes after the verb रम् 'to sport' and जप् 'to whisper' when the case-inflected words स्तम्ब 'a clump of grass' and कर्ण 'ear' are in composition with them respectively.

---
The verb रम् is intransitive and the verb जप् can take an object under very limited circumstances, only namely when the object denotes _Sabda_ ; therefore in the case of both these verbs, the object cannot be in composition as an accusative case; therefore, the _upapada_ here must be a general case-inflected word. Hence we have read the _anuvritti_ of the word सुप् from _sutra_ 4 into this, the _anuvritti_ of the word कर्म्म being inapplicable here.

Vart:- The words to be formed must have the sense of 'elephant' and a 'tale-bearer'. Thus स्तम्बेरमते = स्तम्बेरमः 'an elephant (lit. who sports in cluster of grass)' कर्णे जपति = कर्णेजपः 'a slanderer (lit. who whispers in the ear)'.

The affix अच् is not employed when the words to be formed do not mean an 'elephant' and a 'traducer'. Thus स्तम्बे रन्ता 'who plays in clusters of grass'. कर्णे जपिता मशकः 'the mosquito that hums near the ear'.
