This is an _adhikára_ _sútra_. All the rules of compounding given hereafter, are optional. The same sense can he expressed by the uncompounded words as by them when compounded. But not so are the compounds which have been treated of, before. Compounds like , सुमद्रं, यथाबद्धं, अक्षपरि &c. mentioned above arc invariable compounds (नित्य समास), the sense conveyed by the compound term, not being capable of analysis, by taking the senses of the separate members of the compounds, or at least not capable of expressing any sease without inserting extraneous words on analysis.
