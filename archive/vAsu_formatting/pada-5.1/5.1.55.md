sutra: कुलिजाल्लुक्खौ च
vRtti: द्विगोरित्येव कुलिजशब्दान्ताद् द्विगोः संभवत्यादिष्वर्थेषु लुक्खौ भवतः । चकारात्ष्ठंश्च अन्यतरस्याग्रहणानुवृत्त्या लुगपि विकल्प्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: After the word _kulija_, being the final of a _Dvigu_, there is optionally the elision of the above affixes, or the adding of the affix ख (इन), in the sense of 'what can hold that &c'

---
By च the affix ष्ठन् is also added. The elision being optional, the affix ठञ् (5.1.18) may optionally be elided by (5.1.28). Thus we get four forms: द्विकुलिजिकी (ष्ठन्), द्विकुलिजीना (ख), द्विकुलिजा (ठञ् लुक्), द्वैकुलिजिकी (ठञ्) ॥ In the last example, there is not _vriddhi_ of the second term, though it was so required by (7.3.17). The anomaly is explained by holding that the word कुलिज should be included in the exception along with संज्ञा and शाण of (7.3.17).
