As नद्धा, नद्धुम्, नद्धव्यम्, उपानत्, परीणत् ॥ The त् of the affixes तृ &c, is changed to ध by (8.2.40); and for the preceding ध is substituted द by (8.4.53). उपानत् is formed by (8.2.39), read with (8.4.56). परीणत् is formed by क्विप् as it belongs to सम्पदादि class, the lengthening is by (6.3.116), and ण-change by (8.4.14). It would have shortened the processes of transformation, had only द been ordained in the _sutra_, instead of ध; but the ordaining of ध is for the purposes of (8.2.40), by which there should be ध for the participial त &c, in नद्धम्, and that there should not be the change of this _Nishtha_ त into म by (8.2.42). Thus नध् + त = नध् + ध (8.2.40) नद्धम् (8.4.53) But had the substitute been द, we should have नद् + त = नन्नं by (8.2.42).
