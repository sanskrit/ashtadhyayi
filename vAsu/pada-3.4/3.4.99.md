sutra: नित्यं ङितः
vRtti: ङितो लकारस्य य उत्तमस्तस्य नित्यं सकारस्य लोपो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: There is always elision of the \"_s_\" of the first person of the affixes that come in the room of that \"_la_\" which has an indicatory \"_n_\".

---
The tense-affixes having indicatory ङ् are four, namely, लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ् and लृङ् । In their case, the elision of स् is not optional as was the case in the last _sutra_, but compulsory. See the table already given. In other words, in the Imperfect, Potential, Aorist and Conditional, the स् is elided in the Ist person. Thus अपचाव, अपचाम। The word नित्यं 'always' is used in order to stop the _anuvritti_ of the word 'optionally'.
