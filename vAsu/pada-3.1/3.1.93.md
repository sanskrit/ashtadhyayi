sutra: कृदतिङ्
vRtti: अस्मिन्धात्वधिकारे तिङ्वर्जितः प्रत्ययः कृत्संज्ञको भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In this portion of the _Sutras_ in which there is a reference to verbal roots, any affix except तिङ् (tense-affixes), is called कृत्.

 Thus the affixes तव्यम् &c. are कृत्. All affixes up to the end of this Book belong to this class. These are affixes by which substantives are formed from verbal roots; and they have, therefore, most aptly been termed primary affixes. Words formed by these affixes will be _Pratipadikas_ or crude forms or nominal bases (I. 2. 46). Thus कृ + तव्यं = कर्तव्यं. Why do we say 'except तिङ् affixes'? Observe चीयात् 'may he collect', स्तुयात् 'may he praise' which form verbs and not nouns.
