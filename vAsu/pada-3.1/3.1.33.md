sutra: स्यतासी लृलुटोः
vRtti: लृरूपमुत्सृष्टानुबन्धं सामान्यमेकमेव तस्मिन् लुटि च परतो धातोर्यथासंख्य स्यतासी प्रत्ययौ भवतः ॥
vRtti_eng: When लृ and लुट् follow, then स्य and तासि are respectively the affixes of a verbal root.

लृ is the common expression for लृङ् and लृट् formed by rejecting their special _anubandhas_, and means therefore the 2nd Future and the Conditional tenses. लुट् is the 1st Future also called the Periphrastic Future. Thus करिष्यति अकरिष्यत्, कर्ता. The इ of तासि is indicatory and shows that the nasal of the root is not to be dropped before this; as मन् 'to think', मन्ता 'he will think'.
