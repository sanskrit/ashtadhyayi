sutra: कृत्वोऽर्थप्रयोगे कालेऽधिकरणे
vRtti: कृत्त्वोऽर्थानां प्रत्ययानां प्रयोगे कालेऽधिकरणे षष्ठी विभक्तिर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The sixth case-affix is employed in denoting location (_adhikarana_) after a word denoting time (_kala_) when used along with a word ending with an affix having the sense of _kritvasuch_ (V. 4. 17) 'so many times.'

Ex. पंचकृत्वोऽऽह्नोभुंक्ते 'he eats five times a day.' In short, 'words meaning so many times, or the numeral adverbs of frequency, govern the genitive of time in the sense of locative.' As द्विरह्नोऽधीते 'he studies twice in a day.'

Why do we say 'having the force of कृत्वसुच् ? Observe अह्नि शेते 'he sleeps in the day.'

This rule will not apply when the adverb of frequency is understood, not expressed (_prayoga_) as in अहनि भुक्तम्. Nor when the time is not meant, as द्विः कांस्यापात्र्यां भुंक्ते 'he eats in two brass vessels.' So also when location is not meant : as द्विरह्नो भुंक्ते. The शेष being understood we have द्विरहन्यधीते.
