These participial affixes get collectively this name; and as such they are not limited by the conditions enumerated above; so that they replace not only the affixes of the Present tense but sometimes of Future also (III.3.14.), as well as other tenses. Thus ब्राह्मणस्य कुर्वन्, करिष्यन्, कुर्वाणः, करिष्यमाणः ।

The word सत् occurs in _sutra_ (II.2.11.) &c.
