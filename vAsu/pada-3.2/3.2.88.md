sutra: बहुलं छन्दसि
vRtti: छन्दसि विषये उपपदान्तरेपि हतेर्बहुलं क्विप्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: In the _Chhandas_, the affix क्विप् diversely comes after the verb हन् \"to kill\" with the sense of past time, even when the word in composition with it is other than those mentioned in the last aphorism.

---
This aphorism ordains क्विप् in cases which are not governed by the restrictive rule contained in the last aphorism. As मातृहा सप्तमं नरकं प्रविशेत् 'may the matricide enter the seventh hell'; so also पितृहा 'patricide'.

Diversely we find also मातृघातः and पितृघातः।
