sutra: हेतुमति च
vRtti: हेतुः स्वतन्त्रस्य कर्तुः प्रयोजकः तदीयो व्यापारः प्रेषणादिलक्षणो हेतुमान् तस्मिन्नभिधेये धातोर्णिच् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix णिच् is employed after a root, when the operation of a causer is to be expressed.

The _hetu_ (I.4.55) means the mover of the independent agent; an operation relating to the _hetu_, such as directing &c. is called _hetumat_; as कठं कारयति 'he causes to prepare a mat'; ओदनं पाचवति 'he makes the rice to be cooked'. In other words, the affix णिच् forms the causative verbs.

Vart:- The affix comes also in the sense of 'he does that' after the words सूत्र &c. Thus सत्रं करोति = सूत्रयति 'he makes _sutra_' So also सूत्रयति.

Vart:- After words ending in कृत् affixes and describing legends, comes the affix णिच्, when the sense is ‘he does that'. The कृत् affix is elided, the word reassumes its basic (प्राकृतिक) form, and the base is as if the agent, thus कंसवधिमाचष्टे = कंसं घातयति; बलिबन्धमाचष्टे = बलिं बन्धयति; राजागमनमाचष्टे = राजानम् आगमयति.

Vart:- Under the conditions mentioned in the last वार्तिक, the _upasarga_ आ is elided, when duration of time is meant expressing limit. Thus आरात्रिविवासं आचष्टे = रात्रिं विवासयति; here the आ of आरात्रि is elided.

Vart:- Under the conditions mentioned in the second _vartika_ the affix णिच् has the sense of 'making wonderful', 'meaning attaining that'. Thus उज्जयिन्याः प्रस्थितो माहिष्मत्यां सूर्योद्गमनं सम्भावयते = सूर्यमुद्गमयति 'going from _Ujjain_ he finds the sun rise in _Mahismati_ (wonderful speed)'.

Vart :- When an asterism is in composition and the sense is that of knowing, there comes the affix णिच् after a word ending in कृत् affix, the कृत् affix is elided, the word reassumes its basic form and the base is as if the agent. Thus पुष्ययोगं जानाति = पुष्येण योजयति. So also मघाभिर्योजयति.
