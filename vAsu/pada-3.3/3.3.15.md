sutra: अनद्यतने लुट्
vRtti: भविष्यदनद्यतनेऽर्थे वर्त्तमानाधातोर्लुट्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix \"_Lut_\" comes after a verbal root in the sense of what will happen, but not in the course of the current day.

This debars '_Lrit_'. As श्वः कर्ता 'he will do tomorrow'. श्वो भोक्ता 'he will eat tomorrow'.

The word '_anadyatana_' is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound. Therefore in cases where there is not pure futurity beyond today, but a mixture of the two, लृट् will be employed and not लुट्. As अद्य श्वो वा भविष्यति 'it will be today or tomorrow'. And where there is doubt, the second Future should be employed.

Vart:- The First Future (लुट्) is employed with the force of the Second Future (लृट्) when sorrow is expressed. As इयं तु कदा गन्ता, यैवं पादौ निदधाति । 'Oh when will she go, who places her feet in such a way (who is such a slow walker)' अयं तु कदाऽध्येता, य एवमनभियुक्तः 'when will he learn, who is so inattentive' !
