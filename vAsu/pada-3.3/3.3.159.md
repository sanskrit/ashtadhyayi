sutra: लिङ् च
vRtti: इच्छार्थेषु समानकर्तृकेषु धातुषूपपदेषु धातोर्लिङ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affx '_Lin_' is used after a verb when verbs meaning 'to wish' are in construction with it, and the agent of both the verbs is the same.

Under similar conditions, with words implying 'wish', the Potential is used in the sense of the Infinitive; Thus भुञ्जीय इति इच्छति 'he wishes that he may eat'; अधीयीयेतीच्छति 'he wishes that he will read'.

When the non-completion of the action is implied, the Conditional must be employed under rule (III. 3. 139).
