sutra: खनो घ च
vRtti: खनतेर्द्धातोः करणाधिकरणयोर्घःप्रत्ययो भवति, चकाराद् घञ् च ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix \"_gha_\" as well as \"_ghan_\" comes after the verb \"_khan_\" (to dig), (when the word to be formed is an appellative related to the verb as instrument or location).

The affix घञ् has been read into the _sutra_ by force of the word च । Thus आखानः or आखनः 'a spade, a hoe'.

Vart:- The affix ड also comes in this sense after the verb खन्. Thus आखन् + ड = आखः 'a spade'. The indicatory ड् showing that the final portion called टि should be elided.

Vart:- The affix डर also comes in the same sense; as आखरः 'a spade'.

Vart:- So also the affix इक्:; as आखनिकः 'a spade'.
 
Vart:- So too the affix इकवक as आखनिकवकः 'a spade'.
