sutra: प्रत्यभिवादेऽशूद्रे
vRtti: प्रत्यभिवादो नाम यदत्राभिवाद्यमानो गुरुराशिषं प्रयुङ्क्ते ।  तत्राशूद्रविषये यद्वाक्यं वर्त्तते तस्य टेः प्लुत उदात्तो भवति ॥ इष्टिः ॥ अभिवादवाक्ये यत संकीर्त्तितं नाम गोत्रं वा तद् यत्र प्रत्यभिवाद वाक्यान्ते प्रयुज्यते तत्रप्लुत इष्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: In answer to a salutation, but not when it refers to a _Sudra_, the last vowel of a sentence becomes _pluta_ and gets the acute accent.

The word अभिवादन means "respectful salutation of a superior or elder by an inferior or junior for the sake of obtaining his blessing. It consists of three acts 1. rising from the seat, 2. touching of the feet, 3. the uttering of the formula of salutation". The word प्रत्यभिवादन means, the blessing given by the superior or elder in answer to such salutation. In giving utterance to such blessing, the last vowel of the final word gets _udatta_ and acute, provided that, such blessing is not pronounced on a _Sudra_.

Thus अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं is said by _Devadatta_ to his _Guru_. The latter says भो आयुष्मान् एधि देवदत्ता꣡ ३ ॥ "_O_ _Devadatta_ ! be thou long-lived".

Why do we say when not referring to a _Sudra_? Observe अभिवादये तुषजकोऽहं is said by a _Sudra_. In reply to this the _Guru_ replies भो आयुष्मान् एधि तुषजक !

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated with regard to women also. As अभिवादये गार्ग्यहं is said by _Gargi_. To this the _Guru_ replies :- भो आयुष्मती भव गार्गि ! ॥

Vart:- Some would have this prohibition where a detractor or an arrogant person is addressed. So long as one's arrogance or ridicule does not become manifest, there is prolation. But when one comes to know that he is my detractor, and is really ridiculing me by a show of respect; then the reply is not a blessing, but is, in fact, a curse. Thus अभिवादये स्थाल्यहं भोः, is uttered by the detractor; and the _Guru_ understanding the word _Sthalin_ to be the Proper Name of the person, replies आयुष्मान् एधि स्थालिन् ३ ॥ Then the detractor says, _Sthalin_ is not my Proper Name, but an adjective, like _dandin_, viz. he who has a स्थाल or cooking pot. The _Guru_, believing this to be true, again replies, आयुष्मान् एधि स्थालिन् but without prolation, because the word is not a Proper Noun. The other then says "_O_ Sir, it is not my epithet, it is my Proper Name". The _Guru_ now comes to learn that he is being laughed at, and so gets angry and says असूयकस्त्वं जाल्म ! न प्रत्यभिवादनमर्हसि; भिद्यस्वं वृषल स्थालिन् ! ॥ Here it is a curse, as well as a pun : i. e. "burst thou, _O _sinner ! like unto a cooking pot (_sthalin_ = _sthali_-_vat_).

_Ishti_:- This prolation takes place there only, where the Proper Noun _Gotra_ &c. with which the salutation was made, is employed by the _Guru_ at the end of the sentence; and not where the position of the Proper Name &c. is different. Therefore not here, देवदत्त कुशल्यसि; देवदत्त आयुष्मान् एधि, for here the word _Devadatta_ is not used at the end of a sentence.

Vart:- The prolation is optional, when भोः follows such Proper Name, or when the Person addressed is a _Kshatriya_ or a _Vaishya_. As भो अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं ॥  Reply (1) आयुष्मान् एधि देवदत्त भोः ३ or (2) आयुष्मान् एधि देवदत्त भोः ॥ So also when a _Kshatriya_ is addressed, as अभिवादये इन्द्रवर्म्माहं भोः, Reply (1) आयुष्मान् एधि इन्द्रवर्म्मन् ३ or (2) आयुष्मान् एधि इन्द्रवर्म्मन् ॥_Vaishya_: अभिवादये इन्द्रपालितोऽहं भोः ॥ _Guru_ : आयुष्मानेधि इन्द्रपालित ३ or आयुष्मानेधि इन्द्रपालित ! ॥
