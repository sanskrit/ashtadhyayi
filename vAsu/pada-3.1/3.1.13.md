sutra: लोहितादिडाज्भ्यः क्यष्
vRtti: लोहितादिभ्यो डाजन्तेभ्यश्च भवत्यर्थे क्यष् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क्यष् in the sense of becoming what the thing previously was not, is employed after the words लोहित, &c. and after those that end with the affix डाच् (V.4.57), when these words do not take the affix च्वि (V. 4. 50).

Thus लोहितायते or लोहितायति 'he becomes red'; पटपटायते or पटपटायति 'he makes a noise like _patapata_'; (लोहित + य = लोहिता + य = लोहिताय, (VII.4.25)).

The word पटपटायते is formed by adding the affix _dach_ to the word पट which is first reduplicated, and then takes the denominative affix _kyash_. The affix _dach_ is added to express inarticulate sounds.

There is no special class called _lohitadi_. The _Vartika_, therefore, proposes that the _sutra_ should read without the word _adi_, as लोहितादिभ्यः क्यष्; 'the affix _kyash_ comes after _lohita_, and words ending in _dach_'.

This rule applies to words other than भ्रिशादि which are always invariably _Atmanepadi_ owing to the ङित्, affix क्यङ्, while क्यष् is optionally both. (I.3.90). Thus वर्मायति or वर्मायते, निद्रायति or निद्रायते, करुणायति or करुणायते, कृपायति or कृपायते. The _lohitadi_ is an आकृतिगण, the following being some of the words of this class; लोहित, नील, हरित, पीत, मद्र, फेन and मन्द.

The indicatory क in क्यष् is not for the sake of prohibiting _guna_ and _vriddhi_ (I.1.5). For _guna_ or _vriddhi_ takes place in a _dhatu_ followed by a _sarvadhatuka_ or _ardhadhatuka_ affix. The affix क्यष् is not added to a _dhatu_ but to a nominal stem : hence there is no scope for the operation of _guna_ &c. The क is for the sake of grouping क्यच्, क्यङ् and क्यष् in one class as क्य; as in _sutra_ नः क्ये (I.4.15). There is, however, no word ending in न among those enumerated above.

The affix डाच् (V.4.57) comes when the verb following is one of the three अस्, भू, or कृ; as पटपटाकरोति, -भवति or -स्यात्. The present _sutra_ teaches by implication that when क्यष् follows डाच्, the above restriction, that the verb should be कृ, भू or अस्, is not applicable. Here डाच् comes without the addition of कृ, भू or अस्ति.

The _anuvritti_ of अच्वेः comes from the last _sutra_; and hence the affix मयप् is added in the sense of अभूततद्भाव i.e. something becoming that which it was not before.
