vRtti_eng: And subsequent.

This is also an '_adhikara_' or regulating sutra, and is understood in all subsequent aphorisms; or it might also be called a '_paribhasha_' or interpreting aphorism. That which is called an affix comes after, or is placed after, the '_dhatu_' or root, or the '_pratipadika_' or crude form; as कर्त्तव्यम् and तैत्तिरीयम्.

The force of the word च 'and' in this _sutra_ is to indicate that the affixes here treated of, are to be placed after a root &c.; not so, however the affixes, may sometimes, be placed in the beginning or the middle of a word.
