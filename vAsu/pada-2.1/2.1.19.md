sutra: संख्या वंश्येन 
vRtti: वंशे भवः वंश्यः, तद्वाचिना सुबन्तेन सह संख्या समस्यते अव्ययीभावश्च समासो भवति॥ 
vRtti_eng: A numeral may be compounded with a word denoting 'one belonging to a family' and the resulting compound is _Avyayibhiva_.

The word वंश means uninterrupted descent of persons from a common source whether through birth or knowledge. A succession of teachers and pupils, of ancestors and descendants, &c., would constitute a वंश 'family.' One born in or belonging to such a वंश is called a वंश्य or descendant.	

As, दिमुनि व्याकरणस्य 'of the _Vyakarana_,' which has two sages as its principal expounders viz., _Panini_ and _Patanjali_. So, त्रिमुनिव्याकरणस्य 'having three representatives viz., _Pånini_, _Patanjali_ and _Sakatayana_ or _Katyayana_.' 

When we desire to express their equality as regards knowledge, then both the words are put in the same case: as द्विमुनि or त्रिमुनि व्याकरणम् . 
	
So also when the relationship is by birth: as, एकविंशति भारद्वाजम् Twenty-one _Bharadwajas_. These a subsequent compounds are like _Dvigu_.
