sutra: कर्मणि च ॥
vRtti: कर्मणि च या षष्ठी सा न समस्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: A word ending with a sixth case-affix is not compounded with another, when the force of the genitive case is that of the accusative.

The anuvritti of क्त does not extend to this aphorism. The word karma qualifies _shashthi_. _Sutra_ (II. 3. 66) declares the conditions when, instead of the accusative, the genitive may be employed i. e., when the agent and the object of the action denoted by the nouns formed by _krit_ affixes, are both used in a sentence, the object is put in the genitive case and not the agent; as आश्चर्यो गवां दोहोऽगोपालकेन 'the milking of cows without a cowherd is a wonder.' रोचते ओदनस्य भोजनं देवदत्तेन  'eating of rice agrees with Devadatta.' साधु खलु पयसः पानं देवदत्तेन 'the drinking of milk by Devadatta is indeed excellent.' विचित्रा सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनिना 'wonderful is the structure of sutras by Panini.
