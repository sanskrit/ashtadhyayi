sutra: प्रेदाज्ञः
vRtti: ददातेर्जानातेश्च धातोः प्रेणोपसृष्ठात् कर्मण्युपपदे कप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix क comes after the root दा \"to give\" and ज्ञा \"to know\", when taking the preposition प्र and in composition with a word in the accusative case.

We applied by _sutra_ 3 the affix क after verbs that ended in long आ and had no _upasarga_. Now begins the case of verbs with _upasarga_. This debars the affix अण्; as सर्वप्रदः (VI. 4. 64) 'giver of all; liberal', पथिप्रज्ञः (VI. 4. 64) 'acquainted with roads'. The long आ of दा and ज्ञा is elided by (VI. 4. 64).

Why do we say 'when taking प्र'? With any other _upasarga_ these verbs will take the general affix अण्; as गोसन्दाय.
