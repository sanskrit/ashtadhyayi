sutra: गतिबुद्धिप्रत्यवसानार्थशब्दकर्माकर्मकाणामणिकर्ता स णौ
vRtti: गत्यर्थानां बुद्ध्यर्थानां प्रत्यवसानार्थानां च धातूनां तथाशब्दकर्मकाणामकर्मकाणाञ्च अण्यन्तानां यः कर्त्ता स ण्यन्तानां कर्मसंज्ञा भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: Of the verbs having the sense of 'motion' 'knowledge or information' and 'eating,' and of verbs that have some literary work for their object, and of intransitive verbs that which was the agent of the verb in its primitive (non-_ni_ or non-causal state), is called the object (_karma_) in its causative state (when the verb takes the affix (_ni_).

In the case of the roots that imply 'motion,' 'knowledge' or 'information' or some kind of 'eating,' and other roots having a similar sense; also of roots that have some literary work for their object, and of intransitive roots, that which is the subject of the verb in its primitive sense is put in the Accusative case in the causal, the object remaining unchanged; e. g.

- PRIMITIVE - शत्रवः स्वर्गमगच्छन्, CAUSAL - शत्रून् स्वर्गमगमयत् ।
- PRIMITIVE - स्वे वेदार्थमविदुः, CAUSAL - स्वान् वेदार्थम् अवेदयत् ।
- PRIMITIVE - देवा अमृतमाश्नन्, CAUSAL - देवानमृतमाशयत् ।
- PRIMITIVE - विधिर्वेदध्यैत, CAUSAL - विधिं वेदमध्यापयत् ।
- PRIMITIVE - पृथ्वी सलिले आस्त, CAUSAL - पृथ्वीं सलिले आसयत् ।

But in गमयति रामो गोविन्दं (_Rama_ makes _Govind_ go) if some body else (विष्णु मित्र) prompts _Rama_ to do this, we shall have to say, विष्णुमित्रो रामेण गोविन्दं गमयति '_Vishnu_ _mitra_ prompts _Rama_ to cause _Govind_ to go.' Here '_Rama_' is not put in the Accusative case, because it is the subject of the Verb, not in its primitive, but causal, sense. _Patanjali_, in his _Mahabhashya_, adds this explanation on the meaning of the word शब्दकर्म in the _sutra_ गतिबुद्धि &c. शब्दकर्म may be either शब्दो येषां क्रिया or शब्दो येषं कर्म.

When we take the former interpretation, the roots ह्वयति (ह्वे) क्रंदति (क्रंद) and शब्दायते (denom. of शब्द) have to be excluded from the rule; as, ह्वयति देवदत्तः हाययति देवदत्तेन; क्रंदति-शब्दायते-देवदत्तः; क्रंदयति-शब्दाययति-देवदत्तेन. And the roots श्रु, ज्ञा with वि and लभ् with उप must be included in the rule; as, शृणोति विजानाति-उपलभते-देवदत्तः श्रावयति-विज्ञापयति-उपलंभयति-देवदत्तम्. When we adopt the second interpretation, the roots जल्प्, भाष् with आ and लप with वि, must be included in the rule; हल्पति-विलपति-आभाषते-देवदत्तः, जल्पयति-विलापयति-आभाषयति-देवदत्तं.

There are several exceptions and counter-exceptions to the preceding rule, which are important.

Vart:- The causals of नी 'to lead' and वह् 'to carry,' do not govern the Accusative, but the Instrumental; e. g. भृत्यो भारं नयति वहति वा A servant carries a load. भृत्येन भारं नाययति वाहयति वा (_Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_) (He) causes a servant to carry a load.

Vart:- But वह्, when it has for its subject in the causal a word signifying a 'driver,' obeys the general rule; as, वाहा रथं वहन्ति. Horses draw the chariot. वहंति यवान् वलीवर्दाः.

Vart:- (b). The causals of the roots अद् and खाद्, 'to eat,' govern the Instrumental case; e.g. वटुरन्नमत्ति खादति वा. The boy eats his food. वटुनान्नमादयति खादयति वा. (He) causes the boy to eat his food.

Vart:- (c). भक्ष्, when it has not the sense of हिंसा 'injury to a sentient thing,' governs the Instrumental; as, भक्षयति पिंडीं देवदत्तः, भक्षयति पिंडीं देवदत्तेन; but भक्षयति यवान् बलीवर्दाः, भक्षयति वली वर्दान् यवान्.

By 'intransitive' roots mentioned above is meant such roots as are not by their nature capable of governing an object other than that of 'time,' 'place' &c., and not those roots which, though transitive, may sometimes be used intransitively according to the speaker's volition, or when their meaning is, quite evident; as, किंकरः पचरः पचति. Here पचति, though transitive, is used without an object, because it can be easily understood; hence किंकरेण पाचयति and not किंकरं; but मासमासयति देवदत्तं.

In forming the passive construction of causal verbs, the principal object in the causal, which is the subject (agent) of the verb in its primitive sense, is put in the Nominative case, and the other object remains unchanged; e. g.

- PRIMITIVE - रामो ग्रामं गच्छति., CAUSAL ACTIVE - रामं ग्रामं गमयति., CAUSAL PASSIVE - रामो ग्रामं गम्यते ।
- PRIMITIVE - _Rama_ goes to a village., CAUSAL ACTIVE - (He) causes _Rama_ to go to a village., CAUSAL PASSIVE - _Rama_ is caused to go &c.
- PRIMITIVE - भृत्यः कटं करोति, CAUSAL ACTIVE - भृत्येन भृत्यं वा कटं कारयति., CAUSAL PASSIVE - भृत्यः कटं कार्यते ।
- PRIMITIVE - The Servant prepares a mat., CAUSAL ACTIVE - (He) causes the servant to prepare a mat., CAUSAL PASSIVE - The servant is made to prepare &c.
- PRIMITIVE - गोविंदो मासमास्ते., CAUSAL ACTIVE - गोविंदं मासमासयति, CAUSAL PASSIVE - गोविंदो मासमास्यते ।
- PRIMITIVE - _Govind_ sits for one month., CAUSAL ACTIVE - (He makes _Govind_ sit &c., CAUSAL PASSIVE - _Govind_ is made to sit &c.

(a). But in the case of roots that imply 'knowledge' 'eating,' and those that have a literary work for their object, the principal object is put in the Nominative case, and the secondary in the Accusative, or vice versa e.g. माणवकं धर्मं बोधयति 'he makes _Manavaka_ know his duty'; माणवको धर्मं बोध्यते or माणवकं धर्मो बोध्यते '_Manavaka_ is made known his duty' or 'duty is made known to _Manavaka_'; वटुमोदनं भोजयति 'he makes the boy eat food:' वटुरोदनं भोजयते or वटुमोदनां भोज्यते (_Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_).

With regards to roots that govern two accusatives, the rules mentioned above bold good in their case also; i.e., those roots that imply motion &c., govern the Accusative of the subject of the primitive Case, and others, the Instrumental case, sometimes; as, वामनो बलिं वसुधां याचते : (ईश्वरो) वामनेन बलिं वसुधां याचयति (God) makes _Vamana_ ask _Bali_ for Earth.' गोपोऽजां नगरं हरति; (स्वामी) गोपं गोपेन वाजां नगरं हारयति. '(The master) makes the cowherd take the sheep to the town.'
