sutra: विष्वग्देवयोश्च टेरद्र्याञ्चतौ (ता) वप्रत्यये
vRtti: विष्वक् देव इत्येतयोः सर्वनाम्नश्च टेरद्रीत्ययमादेशो भवति अञ्चतौता वप्रत्ययान्त उत्तरपदे ॥
vRtti_eng: In the room of the last vowel with the consonant that follows it, of a Pronoun and of the words विष्वक् and देव, is substituted अद्रि, when अञ्च with the affix व follows.

Thus विष्वगञ्चति = विष्वद्र्यङ्, This form is thus evolved. अञ्च + क्विन् = अञ्च् + ० = अञ्च् + नुम् (7.1.70) Then there is elision of the final conjunct consonant ऊच्, then the final dental is changed to guttural because of the क्विन् affix (8.2.62), i. e. न् is changed to ङ् and we have अङ् which with विष्वद्रि gives the above form. देवद्र्यङ्, तद्र्यङ्, यद्र्यङ् ॥ अद्रि and सध्रि (6.3.95) have acute on the final irregularly (_nipatan_) in order to prevent the _krit_-accent, and when इ is changed into य् the following vowel becomes _svarita_ (8.2.4). Why do we say of विष्वग् and देव? Observe अश्वाची = अश्वमञ्चति, the feminine ङीप् being added by (4.1.6) _Vartika_ The अ of अच् is elided by (6.4.138.) and the final of अश्व is lengthened by (6.3.138). Why 'when अञ्च् follows'? Observe विष्वग्युक् ॥ Why do we say 'when the affix व् follows'? Observe विष्वगञ्चनं ॥ The व is totally elided by (6.1.67). Another reading of the _sutra_ is अप्रत्यये (अञ्चतावप्रत्यये). It would give the same result, the meaning then being when no affix follows. The word वप्रत्यये or अप्रत्यये indicates by implication that in other places where simply a verb is mentioned, it means a word-form beginning with that verb which ends with some affix. For had अप्रत्यये not been used, then the rule would have applied not only when _anch_ followed, but when _anchana_ ending in ल्युट् also followed. The maxim धातुग्रहणे तदादि विधिरिष्यते is illustrated in अयस्कृतं and अयस्कारः; for (8.3.46) teaches that _visarga_ is changed into स् when कृ follows. There the कृ denotes not only the root कृ but a word derived from कृ, therefore which begins with कृ, such as कारः and कृतः ॥ Therefore the rule applies to forms like अयस्कृत् which is followed merely by the verb कृ; as well as to forms like अयस्कृतः ॥

Vart:- In the Vedas, diversely before the feminine nouns: thus in "विश्वाची व घृताची च" there is no substitution in विश्वाची, but in कद्रीची there is this substitution. कद्रीची is derived from किम् + अञ्च् = कद्रि + अञ्च् ॥ Then is added ङीप् and then like अश्वाची ॥
