sutra: क्रव्ये च
vRtti: क्रव्यशब्द उपपदे अदेर्धातोर्विट्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix विट् comes after the verb अद् \"to eat,\" when the word क्रव्य is in composition with it.

As क्रव्यमत्ति = क्रव्यात् 'carnivorous'.

Why has it been made a separate _sutra_, when this form could have been obtained by the last _sutra_ also? To this the _vartika_ replies: 'This has been made a separate _sutra_ in order to indicate that the rule of वासरूप (III. 1. 94) does not apply here. Therefore the affix अण् will not apply in the alternative. If the affix अण् does not apply, how then we get the form क्रव्यादः which is evidently formed by the affix अण् ? The affix अण् comes after the root when the word formed means the eater of meat which has been cut, dressed and cooked'; thus क्रव्यादः means a man who eats meat cooked and prepared, i. e. a meat-eater as opposed to a vegetarian, while क्रव्यात् means an animal which eats raw flesh; the word क्रव्यादः in fact may be regarded as an irregular form falling under पृषोदरादि class of _sutra_ (VI. 3. 109).
