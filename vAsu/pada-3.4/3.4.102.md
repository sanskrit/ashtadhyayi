sutra: लिङस्सीयुट्
vRtti: लिङादेशानां सीयुडागमो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The personal endings of the Potential and the Benedictive take the augment \"_siyut_\".

---
The ट् of सीयुट् is indicatory and shows that this augment is to be placed before the affixes (I. 1. 46). The उ is for the sake of pronunciation; this rule applies to the _Atmanepada_ affixes. In the Potential, the स् of this augment is elided by (VII. 2. 79), and the य् also, before a personal-ending beginning with a consonant, is dropped according to (VI. 1. 66). In this way, we have पचेत, पचेयाताम्, and by (III. 4. 105), पचेरन् । In the Benedictive, the augment retains its full form, only so far as it is not governed by (VI. 1. 66). Thus पक्षीट, पक्षीयास्ताम् पक्षीरन् ।
