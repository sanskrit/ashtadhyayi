sutra: कुस्तुम्बुरूणि जातिः
vRtti: कुस्तुम्बुरूणीति सुट् निपात्यते जातिश्चेद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The word कुस्तुम्बुरु is irregularly formed with the augment सुट् and means 'a species of herb'.
---  
The कुस्तुम्बुरु is the name of coriander - i. e. धान्यकं; the seeds are also so called. The exhibition of the word in the _sutra_ in the Neuter gender does not however show that the word is always Neuter. When not meaning coriander, the form is कुतुम्बुरु (कुत्सितानि तुम्बुरूणि) ॥ The word तुम्बुरु here means the fruit of the ebony tree.
