Some of the above words would have been governed by the prohibition in (8.3.111), others would never have taken ष, hence their inclusion in this list. The word सु is here a _karmapravachaniya_ (1.4.94) and निर् and दुर् also are not _upasargas_, because they are so only in connection with the verbs गम and क्री; so (8.3.65) does not apply to सेध preceded by निर् and दुर् ॥ The words निःषेधः and दुःषेधः = निर्गतः सेधः or दुर्गतः सेधः ॥ The word सेध here is a घञ् formed word, from षिधू हिंसा संराद्ध्योः; if it be derived from षिध गत्याम्, then also, the word is included here in order to prevent the application of (8.3.113). The words सुषन्धिः, दुःषन्धिः &c are derived from धा with the prepositions सु and सम्, and the affix कि (3.3.92); and the स of सम् is changed to ष् ॥ The words सुष्ठु, दुष्ठु are _Unadi_ formed words (_Unadi_ I. 25). The word गौरिषक्थः is a _Bahuvrihi_, the स of सक्थि is changed to ष् and the _Samasanta_ षच् is added (5.4.113). The long ई of the first member is shortened by (6.3.63). The word प्रतिष्णिका is formed by adding the Preposition प्रति to the root स्ना, and the affix अङ् (3.3.106), and we have प्रतिष्णा with टाप्; then क is added by (5.3.73), and आ shortened (7.4.13), and इ added by (7.3.44). The word नौषेचनं is formed by adding ल्युट् to सिच् ॥ दुन्दुभिषेवणं is also a ल्युट् formed word from सेवति or सीव्यति ॥
