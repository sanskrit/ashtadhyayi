sutra: पापाणके कुत्सितैः
vRtti: पाप अणक एते सुबन्ते कुत्सितवचनैः सह समस्येते, तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति।।
vRtti_eng: The case inflected words _pápa_ 'sin,' and _anaka_ 'insignificant,' are compounded with words expressive of vileness, and the compound is _Tat-purusha_.

Both the words पाप and अणक are words of contempt (कुत्सन) ; by the last _sútra_, they would have stood as second members in the compound; the present _sútra_, however, is so framed with regard to _sútra_ (I.2.43) and (II.2.30), that they will stand as first. As पापनापितः or अणकनापितःः 'a contemptible barber' पाप or अणक-कुलालः 'a contemptible potter.’
