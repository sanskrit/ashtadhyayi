sutra: चिण् भावकर्मणोः
vRtti: धातोः परस्य च्लेश्चिणादेशो भवति भावे कर्मणि तशब्दे परतः ॥

A verb is said to denote an action when it is used impersonally; and it is said to denote an object when used in the Passive sense. As अशायि भवता 'it was lain by you i.e. you lay'; अकारि कटो देवदत्तेन; the mat was made by _Devadatta_'. The repetition of चिण् here is for the sake of distinctness.
