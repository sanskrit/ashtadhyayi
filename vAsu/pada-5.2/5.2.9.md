Thus अनुपदं बद्धा = अनुपदीना 'a kind of shoe'; this word is always feminine. The force of अनु here is that of 'length' or 'likeness'. That is 'a shoe of the measure of a foot'. So सर्वान्नानि भक्षयति = सर्वान्नानोभिक्षुः 'a mendicant who eats the whole food'. So also अयानयीनः शारः 'a chessman or piece that is taken to the position on the chess called _ayanaya_'. The word अयानय is compounded of two words अय, meaning 'going from right to left', and अनय 'from left to right', and it means a particular position in which the pieces moving from right to left and left to right cannot move further, and attack the other pieces.

According to some अयानयीन is the name of the front pieces in ones own row of chess-men. A piece which moves only in one side, does not admit of this affix. The piece which is carried from one side to another, admits of this affix. Others move only in one direction अय or अनय, but not both. _Kaiyyata_: यस्तु शार एक पार्श्य एव संचरति तत्र न भवति प्रत्ययो, यो हि शारः पार्श्वात् पार्श्वान्तरमानीयते, स एव अयानयं नीयते, अन्यास्तु अयमेव नीयते, अनयमेव नीयते वा ॥
