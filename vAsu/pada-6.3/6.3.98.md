sutra: ऊदनोर्द्देशे
vRtti: अनोरुत्तरस्याप ऊकारादेशो भवति देशाभिधाने ॥
vRtti_eng: After अनु, ऊ is substituted for (the अ of) अप्, when the sense is that of a locality.
---  
Thus अनूपो देशः, but अन्वीपम् when locality is not meant. The long ऊ is taught for the sake of showing how the word is to be analysed; as अनु ऊपः = अनूपः ॥ The form अनूपः could have been evolved with a short उ also, as अनु + उपः = अनूपः ॥ But this analysis is not intended.
