sutra: धात्वादेः षः सः
vRtti: धातोरादेः षकारस्य स्थाने सकारादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "There is the substitution of स in the room of ष् being the initial of a verbal root as enunciated in the _Dhatupatha_."
---
The roots exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ with an initial ष, change it for स ॥ Thus षह -सहते, षिच् - सिंचति ॥ Why do we use the word 'root'? Observe षोडश, षडिकः, षण्डः ॥ Why do we say 'initial'? Observe – कर्षति, कृषति ॥ Why have then roots been exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ with an initial ष, when for all practical purposes this  ष is to be replaced by स, would it not have been easier to spell at once these words with a स ? This appears cumbersome no doubt, but the spelling of the roots with ष is for the sake of brevity. Certain roots change their स into ष when preceded by certain letters: those roots which thus change their letter स for ष have been at once taught with an initial ष, and thus by (VIII. 3. 59) their स is changed to ष ॥ Thus from सिव - instead of सिसव we have सिषव ॥ Thus root is exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ with a ष, and thus we know that the स must be changed to ष ॥ Otherwise a list of such roots would have to be separately given. One must refer to the _Dhatupatha_ for a list of such roots. As a general rule, however, all roots beginning with a स and followed by a vowel or a dental letter have been taught in the _Dhatupatha_ as beginning with an initial ष, as well as the following roots स्मि, स्वद्, स्विद्, स्विज् and स्वप्, though followed by म् or व् ॥ The following roots though followed by a vowel or a dental are not taught with an initial ष viz. सृप्, सृज्, स्तृ, स्त्या, सेकृ and सृ ॥

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated of the roots derived from nouns, and of ष्ठिव् and ष्वष्क ॥ Thus षोडीयते, षण्डायते are roots derived from nouns, and though these roots begin with ष are not changed: so ष्ठिव् – ष्ठिवति, ष्वष्क – ष्वष्कते ॥ The word ष्ठिव contains in it two roots ष्ठिव् and ष्थिव्, one with ठ, another with थ, and thus we have two forms in the reduplication :- तेष्ठीव्यते, टेष्ठीव्यते ॥ The substitution of स for ष takes place in the case of the root that has थ ॥
