sutra: उत्परस्यातः
vRtti: चरफलोरभ्यासात्परस्यात उकारादेशो भवति यङ्यङ्लुको परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: For the subsequent अ (i.e. for the अ of the root and not of the reduplicate), there is substituted उ in the Intensive (with or without यङ्) of चर् and फल् ॥

The examples have been given above, as चंचूर्यते, चंचूरीते and पंफुल्यते पंफुलीते ॥ Why do we say 'the अ which stands subsequent to the reduplicate'? The substitute does not replace the अ of the reduplicate. Why do we say 'of अ'? The substitute should not replace the final letter, which it otherwise would have done by (1.1.52). The त् in उत् debars _guna_ (7.3.86) in चंचूर्ति and पंफुलीति, for though उ is lengthened by (8.2.77), in चंचूर्ति, yet that lengthening is considered as non-existent or _asiddha_ (8.2.1) for the purposes of _Guna_ (7.3.86). Quere. If the त् in उत् debars _guna_, why should it not debar lengthening also of (8.2.7)?
