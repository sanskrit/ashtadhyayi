sutra: प्रथमानिर्दिष्टं समासउपसर्जनम्
vRtti: प्रथमया विभक्तया यन्निर्दिश्यते समासशास्त्रे तदुपसर्जनसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "In (this book, in the _sutras_ relating to) compound, the word that is exhibited in the first (Nominative) case, is called _upasarjana_ or the secondary word."

This defines or rather describes the _Upasarjana_. In the _sutras_ referring to compounds, the words that have the case termination of the nominative, are called _Upasarjanam_.

Thus _sutra_ (II. 1. 24) (द्वितीया श्रितातीत पतितगतात्यस्तप्राप्तापन्नैः) is a _samasa_ _sutra_ enjoining composition. In this _sutra_ the word द्वितीया is exhibited in the nominative case, and the remaining words are in the Instrumental case. The _sutra_ means: "An accusative (द्वितीया) is compounded with the words श्रित, अतीत, पतित, गत, अत्यस्त, प्राप्त, and आपन्न and forms _Tat_-_purusha_". Therefore, in forming accusative compounds, the word having the accusative case will be called _Upasarjana_. Thus कष्टं + श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः. Here the word कष्टं being _Upasarjana_, stands first in the compound, by Rule (II. 2. 30). उपसर्जनं पूर्वम्, (in a compound the _Upasarjana_ should be placed first). Similarly in rules relating to the formation of instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive and locative _Tat_-_purusha_, the words standing in those cases will be _Upasarjana_. Thus शंकुलाखण्डः, यूपदारु, वृकभयम्, राजपुरुषः, अक्षशौण्डः.

_Upasarjana_ is, therefore, that word which either by composition or derivation loses its original independent character, while it also determines the sense of another word called प्रधान or principal.
