sutra: नतिसृचतसृ
vRtti: तिसृ चतसृ इत्येतयोर्नामि दीर्घो न भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The finals of तिसृ and चतसृ are not lengthened before नाम् ॥

As तिसृणाम्, चतसृणाम् ॥ The very fact of this prohibition proves by implication that the final ऋ of these words is not changed to र before a genitive plural, (7.2.100) notwithstanding. In fact नुट् is added before scope is given to that rule, and thus the preceding rule (7.1.54) prevents the application of the subsequent rule (7.2.100).
