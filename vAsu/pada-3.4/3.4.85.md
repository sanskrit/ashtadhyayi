This is an अतिदेश _sutra_; as in the लङ् there are the affixes ताम्, तम्, त, व and म, so also in the लोट् । Thus पचताम्, पचतम्, पचत, पचाव, पचाम ।

Q -- If लोट् is like लङ्, why have we not the augment अट्, आट्, or the substitution of जुस् or झि (see (3.4.111)) in the case of लोट् also ?

A. -- The वा of _sutra_ (3.4.83) is understood in this _sutra_ also, so that the analogy between लोट् and लङ् is a limited analogy and does not make all the rules which are applicable to लङ्, equally applicable to लोट् also.
