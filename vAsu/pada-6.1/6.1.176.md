sutra: ह्रस्वनुड्भ्यां मतुप्
vRtti: अन्तोदात्तादित्येव । ह्रस्वान्तादन्तोदात्तान्नुटश्चपरोमतुब् उदात्तो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The otherwise unaccented मत् (वत्) takes the acute accent, when an oxytoned stem ends in a light vowel, or the affix has before it the augment न् (VIII. 2. 16).

The word अन्तोदात्तात् is understood here also. Thus अग्निमा꣡न्, वायुमा꣡न्, कर्तृमा꣡न्, हर्तृमा꣡न् ॥ So also when मतुप् takes नुट्, as अक्ष॒ण्व꣡ता, शी॒र्ष॒ण्व꣡ता ॥ Here by (7.1.76), the word अक्षि takes अनङ् and becomes अक्षन्, then is added नुट् by (8.2.16), and we have अक्षन् न् मतुप् ॥ The preceding न् is elided. When the stem is not oxytone (_antodatta_) this rule does not apply: as व꣡सुमान् ॥ The word व꣡सु has acute on the first syllable, as it is formed from वस् with the affix उ (_Un_ I. 10) which is नित् (_Un_ 1.9) so the मतुप् retains its _anudatta_ here. So also in the case of मरुत्वान्, the affix does not become acute, though the word मरु꣡त् has acute on the final as the intervening त् makes the उ of रु heavy when the affix is added: the general maxim स्वरर्विधौ व्यंजनमविद्यमानवत् does not apply here, because the very fact that न् is only taken as an exception, shows this.

Vart:- The affix मतुप् becomes acute after the heavy vowel of रे : as आरेवा꣡न् = रयिरस्यास्ति ॥ There is vocalisation of य of रयि, as र इ इ then substitution of one, as र इ, then _guna_, रे ॥

Vart:- The prohibition should be stated after त्रि : as त्रि꣡वतीर्याज्यानुवाक्या भवन्ति ॥
