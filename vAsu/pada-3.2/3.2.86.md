sutra: कर्मणि हनः
vRtti: कर्मणि उपपदे हन्तेर्धातोर्णिनिप्रत्ययो भवति भूते काले ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix णिनि comes after the verb हन् \"to kill\", with the sense of past time, when the word in composition is in the accusative case.

---
As पितृव्यघातिन् 'who has killed his paternal uncle'; मातुलघातिन् 'who has killed his maternal uncle'; हन् + णिनि = घन् + णिनि (VII. 3. 54) = घत् + णिनि (VII. 3. 32) = घातिन् (VII. 2. 116).

This affix is employed only when censure is implied. Therefore it is not employed in चोरं हतवान् 'he has killed the thief'.

The _anuvritti_ of the word कर्मणि of this aphorism extends up to _sutra_ (III. 2. 96).
