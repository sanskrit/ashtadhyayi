sutra: गापोष्टक्
vRtti: गायतेः पिबतेश्च धातोः कर्मण्युपपदेऽनुपसर्गे टक्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix टक् comes after the verbs गै 'to sing' and पा 'to drink' when used without a preposition, and when the object is in composition with it.

The phrase _anupasarga_ is to be read again into this _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from _sutra_ 3, though this _anuvritti_ had temporarily lain dormant in _sutra_ 6 and 7. as being unnecessary. This debars क; of this affix ट् and क are indicatory the ट् showing among others that the feminine is formed by the affix ङीप् (IV. 1. 14)

As, शक्रं गायति = शक्र + गा + टक् =शक्रगः (VI. 4. 64) 'who sings _Sakra_ hymns'. सामगः 'singer of _Sama_'. fem. शक्रगी and सामगी ।

Vart:- The affix टक् comes after the verb पा when it means to drink and only when it is in composition with the words सुरा and शीधु as its object. This is an important modification of the general _sutra_. Thus सुरापः fem. सुरापी 'wine-bibber'; शीधुपः fem. शीधुपी 'spirit-drinker'.

Why do we say 'when in composition with _sura_ and _sidhu_'? Observe क्षीरपा ब्राह्मणी 'the milk-drinking _Brahmani_'; formed by the affix क and the feminine, therefore, not formed by the affix ई but by आ.

Why do we say 'when पा means to drink'? When पा means 'to protect' this affix is not used; as सुरापा 'who protects wine'.

When these words are compounded with an _upasarga_ they do not take टक् but अण्; as शक्रसंगायः, सामसंगायः ।

Vart:- There is diversity in the _Chhandas_ as to the employment of these affixes; as या ब्राह्मणी सुरापी or सुरापा भवति नैनां देवाः पतिलोकं नयन्ति 'the gods do not carry that _Brahmani_ to the regions of her husband who drinks wine'.
