sutra: कतरकतमौ जातिप्रश्ने
vRtti: कतर-कतमौ जाति-परिप्रश्ने वर्तमानौ समर्थेन सुपा सह समस्यते तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The words _katara_ ‘which or who of two’ and _katama_ \"which or who of many\", when used in asking questions about the genus or class, are compounded with other case-inflected words with which they are in construction, and the compound is _Tat-purusha_.

As कतरकठः and कतरकालापः 'which of the two is _katha_, and which _kálápa_?' कतरकठः and कतरकालापः ‘which of these is _katha_ &c.'

It might be objected, 'what is the use of employing the word जातिपरिप्रश्न in the aphorism; since the word कतम is especially employed in asking such questions; (see V, S. 93) and the word कतर will get the same signification by being read along with it?' The very use of this phrase in the aphorism shows that the word कतम has other meanings besides that of an interrogative pronoun, of determining _játi_; as कतरो भवतोर्देवदत्तः ‘which of you two, Sirs, is _Devadatta_,' and कतमो भवतां देवदत्तः ‘which of you, Sirs, is _Devadatta_.’ Here there is no questioning about _játi_; all belonging to the same genus, hence there is no compounding. (Accent VI. 2. 57.)
