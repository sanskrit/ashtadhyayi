sutra: इन्धिभवतिभ्यां च
vRtti: इन्धिभवतीत्येताभ्यां परो लिट् प्रत्ययः किद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The _Lit_ or Perfect Tense affixes after the roots _indhi_ 'to kindle,' and _bhu_ 'to become,' also are _kit_.

---
After these two roots the terminations of the Perfect are कित्. These roots have been especially mentioned, because the root इन्धि ending in a compound consonant will not be governed by _sutra_ (1.2.5); and the root भू is mentioned because all the terminations of the Perfect are कित् after भू, not excepting the पित् terminations. Thus the verbs समीधे and ईधे are illustrations of Perfect Tense from the root इन्ध् as in the following examples :- समीधे दस्युहन्तमम्, (_Rig_ _Veda_ 6.16.15), and पुत्र ईधे अथर्वणः, (_Rig_ _Veda_ 6.16.14). Here the nasal of the root is dropped by regarding the affix as कित् ॥ Similarly from the root भू, we have बभूव, वभूविथ ॥

Vart.:- This rule should be applied also to the verbs श्रंथ् 'to loosen,' श्रंथ् 'to fasten,' दंभ् 'to injure' and स्वंज् 'to embrace.' As श्रेथतुः 'thou hast loosened,' श्रंथ + अतुस् = श्रथ् + अतुस्. (The न् is elided by the rule already mentioned in the last _sutra_, viz. (6.4.24).

= श्रथ् + श्रथ् + अतुस् = श्रेथतुः (6.4.120), Similarly श्रेथतुः; देभतुः, परिषस्वजे, परिषस्वजाते.
