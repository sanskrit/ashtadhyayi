sutra: जुचङ्क्रम्यदन्द्रम्यसृगृधिज्वलशुचलषपतपदः
vRtti: जु प्रभृतिभ्यो धातुभ्यो युच् प्रत्ययो भवति तच्छीलादिषु कर्तृषु ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix युच् comes after the following verbs in the sense of 'the agent having such a habit &c', viz:- जु, चंक्रम्य, दन्द्रम्य, सृ, गृध, ज्वल, शुच, लष, पत and पद.
---
The verb जु is not to be found in the _Dhatupatha_, and is taught in the aphorisms and is hence called a _sautra_ _dhatu_. It means 'to go', 'to be quick'. As जु + युच् = जो +अन (VII. 1. 1.) and (VII. 3. 84) = जवनः (VI. I. 78), (II. 3. 46) 'a courser, a swift horse'. चंक्रम्य + युच् = चंक्रम् + अन् (II. 4. 74) = चंक्रमनः 'moving about'; so also दंद्रमणः 'wandering'; सरणः 'flowing'; गर्द्धनः 'greedy'; ज्वलनः 'burning'; शोचनः 'grieving'; लषणः 'desiring'; पतनः 'falling'; पदनः 'moving'.

The enumeration of the word पद in the above, indicates that this _sutra_ applies to the transitive verbs; otherwise the _sutra_ (III. 2. 148) would have been sufficient, as पद is a चलनार्थ verb. Others say that the inclusion of पद् in this aphorism indicates the existence of the _paribhasha_ already given under _sutra_ (III. 2. 146) i.e. the rule of (III. 1. 94) has no concern with affixes added in the sense of 'having such a habit &c'. The affix इष्णुच् which by (III. 2. 136) is added to अलंकृतम्, supersedes therefore not merely the addition of तृन् to अलंकृतम् (III. 2. 135), but also the addition of ण्वुल् to the same. If a _tachchhilika_ _apavada_ were to supersede only an _atachchhilika_ _utsarga_, it would have been superfluous for _Panini_ to teach in this _sutra_ the addition of युच् to पद्, because in that case the addition of युच् to पद् by (III. 2. 154) would not have debarred the addition of युच् to पद् by (III. 2. 149). The repetition is for the sake of _jnapana_, therefore, and it indicates the existence of the above-mentioned maxim. The _jnapaka_ is not, however, of universal application; for sometimes both affixes are applied concurrently; as, गन्ता खेटं विकत्थनः ।
