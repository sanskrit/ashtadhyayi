sutra: दिसंख्ये संज्ञायाम् 
vRtti: दिग्वाधिनः शब्दाः संख्या च समानाधिकरणेन सुबन्तेन सह समस्यन्ते, तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति ।। 
vRtti_eng: Tho words expressing a point of the compass, or a number (_sankhyá_) enter into composition with the word correlated to them by being in the same case, when the sense of the compound is thit of an appellative; and it is a _Tat-purusha_.

The phrase 'being in apposition,' is understood in every one of these _sútras_ up to the end of the chapter. 

- As पूर्वेषुकामशमी 'the town of _Ishukamatami_ -in-the-east.' अपरेषुकामशमी the town of _Ishukamasami_ -in-the-west.' पंचाम्राः 'the five mangoes' सप्तर्षयः 'the seven-sages' (the constellation of the Great Bear), 

Why do we say ‘when the sense is that of an appellative ?' Observe उत्तरा वृक्षा: 'northern trees.' पञ्च ब्राह्मणाः 'five Brahmanas.' See IV. 2. 107.
