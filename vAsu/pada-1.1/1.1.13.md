sutra: शे
vRtti: शे इत्येतत् प्रगृह्यसंज्ञं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix शे, (the Vedic substitute of the case-affixes), is a _pragrihya_.

In the Vedic Sanskrit, the declension of nouns sometimes differs somewhat from the ordinary Sanskrit. One of the peculiar Vedic terminations, which replace the ordinary declensional terminations is called शे (VII.1.39). Thus अस्मेइन्द्राबृहस्पती.

Of this substitute शे, the initial श is indicatory, the real suffix being ए. This final ए is a _pragrihya_.

In the sacred literature there is only one example of this _pragrihya_, as given above; while in imitation of this, we have in secular writing phrases as, त्वेइति, युष्मे इति, मे इति &c.
