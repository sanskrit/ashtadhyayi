sutra: कर्मणि भृतौ
vRtti: कर्मशब्द उपपदे कर्मवाचिनि करोतेष्ठप्रत्ययो भवति भृतौ गम्यमानायाम् ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ट comes after the verb कृ 'to make', when the word कर्म is in composition with it, and the sense of the word to be formed is that of wages.

The word भृति means service for hire, wages. The word कर्म does not mean the grammatical object but the word-form कर्म; as कर्मकरः 'a hired labourer' (not a slave); otherwise the affix is अण्; as कर्मकारः 'an artisan'.
