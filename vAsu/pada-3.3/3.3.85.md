sutra: उपघ्न आश्रये
vRtti: उपपूर्वस्य हन्तेरप्प्रत्यय उपधालोपश्च निपात्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The word '_upaghna_' is irregularly formed meaning 'an inclined place for leaning or support'.

---
It is formed by adding अप् (3.3.76) to the verb हन् preceded by the _upasarga_ उप, then eliding the penultimate अ of ह; this is the irregularity. Then by _sandhi_ rules हन् is changed into घ्नः । This form would have been given by the affix क also, without any irregularity.

The word आश्रय refers to 'proximity, contiguity'. Thus पर्वतोघ्नः 'the declivity of the mountain'; so also ग्रामोपघ्नः 'bordering the village'.

Why do we say 'when meaning support'? Observe पर्वतोपघातः ।
