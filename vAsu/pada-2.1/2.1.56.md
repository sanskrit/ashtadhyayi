sutra: उपमितं व्याघ्रादिभिः सामान्याप्रयोगे
vRtti: उपमेयमुपमितं तद्वाचि सुबन्तं  व्याघ्रादिभिः सामर्थ्याद्   उपमानवचनैः सह समस्यते, तत्पुरुषश्च समासो भवति , न चेत्सामान्यवाचि शब्दः प्रयुज्यते ।।
vRtti_eng: A case-inflected word denoting subject of comparison is compounded with the words _vyåghra_ 'tigur,' &c., the latter being the standard of comparison, and in construction with the former; and the compound is _Tat-purusha_; provided that any word expressing the common characteristic (सामान्य) as explained above, is not employed.

This is a modification of _sůtra_ 57, by which the objective would have stood first; by the present, the attribute stands second. As पुरुषोऽयं  व्याघ्र इव = पुरुषव्याघ्रः 'a person-tiger' (in strength) पुरुषसिंहः

In the last _sutra_, the compounding was between the उपमान  and the common quality. In the present, the compounding is between the उपमित  and certain उपमान but never with सामान्य वचन. Therefore we can not form this kind of compound from the following sentence:- पुरुषो व्याघ्र इव शूरः 'a man strong as a tiger.' Similarly मुखपद्मम्, मुखकमलं, करकिसलयम्, पार्थिवचन्द्रम्॥

The words व्याघ्र  &c. are आकृतिगणः  i. e., this is a class of compound words, the fact of a word belonging to which, is known by its form, a posteriori and is not discoverable by any consideration of its constituent parts a priori.

The following is the list of such words:-  1. व्याघ्र  = A tiger. 2. सिंह  = A lion. 3. ऋक्ष = A bear. 4. ऋषभ = A bull. 5. चन्दन = Sandal. 6. वृक = A wolf. 7. वृष = A bull!. 8. वराह = A boar, hog. 9. हस्तिन = An elephant. 10. तरु  = A tree. 11. कुञ्जर = An elephant. 12. रुरु = A kind of deer. 13. पृषत = The spotted antelope. 14. पुण्डरीक = A lotus flower. 15. पलाश  = A tree Butea Frondosa. 16. कितव = A rogue, cheat.

आकृतिगणोऽयम्

1. मुखपद्मम्     A lotus-like face.
2. मुखकमलम्     A lotus-like face.
3. करकिसलयम् = Sprout-like hand, a tender hand. 4. पार्थिवचंद्र: .
