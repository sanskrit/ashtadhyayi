Vart:- The words श्रेणि &c., for the purposes of this _sutra_, are supposed to have the force of the affix च्वि (_chvi_). Thus अश्रेणयः श्रेण्यः कृताः= श्रेणिकृताः  'made into classes' (those who were not classified before).

The class of words called कृतादि are _akriti-gana_ and cannot be known a priori. This _Samasa_ is also an invariable _Samasa_ by reason of _sutra_ (II. 2. 18), since all words that end in _chvi_ ( च्वि ) are called _gati_ (1. 4. 61.)
