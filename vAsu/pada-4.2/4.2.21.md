sutra: सास्मिन्पौर्णमासीतिसंज्ञायाम्
vRtti: सेति प्रथमासमर्थाद् अस्मिन्निति सप्तम्यर्थे यथाविहितं प्रत्ययो भवति, यत्तत्प्रथमासमर्थं पौर्णमासी चेद्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अण् comes after the name of a full-moon-night, to denote the division of time in which the night falls.

The word स means 'that'. It is in the nominative case, therefore by (IV.1.82) it means that "after a word in the first case in construction". अस्मिन् 'in it' i.e. in the sense of a seventh case. पौर्णमासीति "if the word in the first case in construction is the name of a full-moon night". The word इति after पौर्णमासी is used for the sake of clearness. The word संज्ञायाम् does not occur in the original _sutras_ of _Panini_; but is added by a _Vartika_; and means 'if the word so formed is an appellative', i. e. if it is the name of a month, a half-month and a year. The whole _sutra_ therefore literally translated means "the affix अण् already ordained (IV. I. 83) comes in the sense of a 7th case affix, after a word in the Ist case in construction, if that word is the name of a full-moon-night, provided that the whole word so formed is an appellation of a month, a half-month or a year".

Thus पौषी पौर्णमासी अस्मिन् = पौषो मासः 'the month _Paus_ i. e. that month in which the moon is full in the asterism _Pushya_'. Similarly पौषऽर्द्धमासः and पौषः संवत्सरः ॥ But not so in the following पौषी पौर्णमासी अस्मिन् दशरात्रे, because _dasaratra_ is not a month or a fortnight or a year.

The words इति and संज्ञायाम् have the same force here, namely, they make the word an appellative. The word संज्ञायाम् added to the _sutra_ by the _Vartika_ is a redundancy.

The word पौर्णमासी is formed by adding अण् to पूर्णमास ॥ Or it may be evolved in this way:-पुर्णो माः = पूर्णमाः, पूर्णमास इयम् पौर्णमासी ॥ The word माः means "moon".
