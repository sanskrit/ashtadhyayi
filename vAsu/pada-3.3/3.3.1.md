sutra: उणादयो बहुलं
vRtti: उणादयः प्रत्यया वर्त्तमानेऽर्थे संज्ञायां विषये बहुलं भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes '_Un_' and the rest, with the force of the present, and with a sense simply appellative, are attached diversely.

---
The phrase 'with the force of the present' (implying neither past nor future time) and 'with a sense simply appellative' (and not descriptive) must be read into this _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from _sutras_ (III. 2. 123) & (III. 2. 185). By using the word 'diversely' it is indicated that these affixes are, of course, applied after roots about which they are ordained, but they come also after roots about which they are not ordained. Sometimes we must infer their application by seeing actual words. Some affixes, though there be no express injunction regarding them, are to be inferred to belong to this class. The maxim in regard to the _Unadi_ affixes is that when, in appellatives, we find the forms of verbal roots and affixes coming after them, then we may know, from the result as presented in the word, what are the indicatory letters which the affix must be possessed of in order to produce the result.

These affixes are not given in _Panini_'s work, but they have been separately collected. The affix उण् is the first of these. The first _sutra_ of _Unadi_ affixes is the following-

कृवापाजिमिस्वदिसाध्यशूभ्य उण् ॥

The affix उण् comes after the verbs कृ 'to make', वा 'to blow', पा 'to drink', जि 'to overcome', नि 'to scatter', स्वद 'to be pleasant to the taste', साध् 'to accomplish', and अश् 'to pervade'.

Thus कृ + उण् = कारुः 'an artisan'. So also, वायुः 'the wind'; पायुः 'the organ of excretion'; जायुः 'a drug (which overcomes disease)'; मायुः 'the bile'; स्वादुः 'sweet'; साधुः 'who accomplishes the object of another, hence virtuous'; and आशुः 'quickly'.

These _Unadi_ affixes come after a limited number of roots, and not after every root, as the affixes taught in this grammar whose application is general; hence the word बहुल has been employed. Moreover there has been no exhaustive enumeration of the several roots after which these affixes come: only some of them have been collected in works treating of _Unadi_ affixes. Thus though the affixes उलच् is ordained after हृष, it comes also after शक as शङ्कुला. In fact there is a long discussion and it was a moot point at the time of _Panini_ whether these words said to be formed by _Unadi_ affixes were really derivative, or primitive ones. Moreover all the operations of these affixes have not been shown, that is their effects are not without remainder (सशेष). They are valid and good if found in sacred Scriptures or secular literature. The authors of _Niruktas_ and grammarians of the school of _Sakatayana_, consider all nouns and substantives (नाम) as derivative words from simple roots (धातुज). Therefore where the derivation of a word is not apparent, one should infer the existence of proper base (प्रकृति) or affix (प्रत्यय) to form such a word.

The following slokas will be of some use to the student for ascertaining the _Unadi_ affixes.

बाहुलकं प्रकृतेस्तनुदृष्टेः प्रायसमुच्चयनादपि तेषाम् ।
कार्यसशेषविधेश्च तदुक्तं नैगमरूढिभवं हि सुसाधु ॥ १ ।
नाम च धातुजमाह निरुक्ते व्याकरणे शकटस्य च तोकम् ।
