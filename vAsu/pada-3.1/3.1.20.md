vRtti: पुच्छ भाण्ड चीवर इत्येतेभ्यो णिङ् प्रत्ययो भवति करणविशेषे ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix णिङ्, in the sense of making, comes after these words as the object of the action, viz:- पुच्छ 'tail', भाण्ड 'pot' and चीवर 'rag'.

Thus उत्पुच्छयते 'he lifts up the tail', (the sense must be that of lifting or throwing about); सम्भाण्डायते 'he collects pots in a heap'; सञ्चीवरायते भिक्षुः 'the beggar collects or wears rags'. Of the affix णिङ्, the effective portion is इ, the other letters are servile. The ङ indicates _Atmanepada_ (I. 3. 12)and ण serves the purposes of the application of the rule (VI. 4. 51) which applies generally to all affixes containing णि, such as णिङ्, णिच् &c.

Vart:- After the word पुच्छ् the sense of the affix is that of lifting or throwing about.

Vart:- After भाण्ड the sense of the affix is that of accumulation in a heap.

Vart:- After चीवर the sense of the affix is that of acquiring or wearing.
