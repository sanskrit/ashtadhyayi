sutra: कच्छादिभ्यश्च
vRtti: कच्छ इत्येवमादिभ्यो देशवाचिभ्योऽणप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The affix अण् comes, in the remaining senses, after the words _kachchha_ &c denoting places."

The word देशे is understood here. This debars वुञ् &c. Thus काच्छः, सैन्धवः, वार्णवः &c. The words कच्छ &c. are not invariable plural words, because by the next _sutra_, it is shown that these words may signify men and their habits &c. The word विजापक occurs in this list. It would have taken अण् by the last _sutra_ also, because it has क as its penultimate. Its mention in the list is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_ by which it takes वुञ् also under certain conditions.

1 कच्छ, 2 सिन्धु, 3 वर्णु, 4 गन्धार, 5 मधुमत्, 6 कम्बोज, 7 कश्मीर, 8 साल्व, 9 कुरु, 10 अनुषण्ड (अणु, अण्ड, खण्ड) 11 द्वीप, 12 अनूप, 13 अजवाह, 14 विजापक, 15 कलूतर (कुलून)16 रङ्कु ॥
