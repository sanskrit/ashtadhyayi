sutra: द्विषत्परयोस्तापेः
vRtti: द्विषत्परयोः कर्मणोरुपपदयोस्तापेर्धातोः खच्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix खच् comes after the verb ताप्, \"to heat\", when द्विषत् or पर is the word in composition with it as an object.

The verb तप् belongs both to _Bhu_ and _Chur_ classes. Both are meant in the _sutra_. In the case of _Bhvadi_, the verb तापि is the causative ending in णि of तप्; while in _Churadi_, all verbs take णि.

Thus द्विषन्तं तापयति = द्विषन्तपः (VI. 4. 94) 'one who destroys his enemies', so also परन्तपः 'one who subdues his enemies, a hero'.

This affix however, will not apply when the above _upapadas_ are in the feminine gender. In this case the general affix अण् will be employed; as द्विषतीं तापयति = दिषतीतापः ।
