Thus द꣡न्तलेखकः, न꣡खलेखकः, अ꣡वस्करशोधकः, र꣡मणीयकारकः = दन्तलेखनादिभिर्येषां जीविका ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. 2. 17). Why do we say when meaning 'means of living'? Observe इक्षुभक्षिकां मे धारयसि ॥ All affixes which ultimately become अक by taking substitutes, are called अक affixes. Thus ण्वुल्, वुन् &c are अक affixes (VII. I. I). Why do we say "ending in the affix अक"?
Observe रमणीयकर्त्ता ॥ Here the compounding takes place by (II. 2. 17), and the affix तृच् is added in the sense of sport and not of livelihood.
