sutra: कर्णो वर्णलक्षणात्
vRtti: बहुव्रीहौ समासे वर्णवाचिनो लक्षणवाचिनश्च कर्णशब्द उत्तरपदमाद्युदात्तं भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "In a _Bahuvrihi_ compound, the word कर्ण standing as second member, has acute on the first syllable, when it is preceded by a word denoting color or mark."

Thus with color we have शुक्लक꣡र्णः, कृष्णक꣡र्ण, and with mark-name, we have दात्राक꣡र्णः शङ्कूक꣡र्णः, the lengthening of दात्र and शंकु takes place by (VI. 3. 115). The marks of 'scythe', 'arrow' &c, are made on the ears of cattle to mark and distinguish them. It is such a 'mark' which is meant here, therefore, the rule does not apply to स्थूलकर्णः ॥ Why do we say कर्ण? Observe श्वेतपादः, कूटशृङ्गः here श्वेत being formed by अच् (II. I. 134) is end-acute, and कूट being formed by क (III. I. 135) is also end-acute and these accents are retained in the compound. Why do we say "when preceded by a word denoting color or mark"? Observe शोभनपादः where शोभन being formed by युच् (II. 2. 149) is end-acute and this accent is retained (VI. 2. 1).
