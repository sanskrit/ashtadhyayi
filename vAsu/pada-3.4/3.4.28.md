sutra: यथातथयोरसूयाप्रतिवचने
vRtti: यथा तथा शब्दयोरुपपदयोः कृञो णमुल् प्रत्ययो भवति, असूया प्रतिवचने गम्यमाने ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix \"_namul_\" is added to the root \"_kri_\" (to make), the words \"_yatha_\" and \"_tatha_\" being compounded with it, when an angry reply is made : (if the omission of \"_krin_\" is unobjectionable).

When one questions or replies in indignation, displeasure or anger, then is this construction valid. Thus तथाकारं भोक्ष्ये, किं तवानेन 'l will eat in that way; what is that to you'? Similarly यथाकारं भोक्ष्ये, किं तवानेन ।

Why do we say 'when an angry reply is made'? Observe यथाकृत्वाऽहं भोक्ष्ये तथा त्वं द्रक्ष्यसि 'in what way I will eat, that thou wilt see'.

Why do we say 'when the omission of कृञ् would be valid'? Witness यथाकृत्वाऽहं शिरो भोक्ष्ये किं तवानेन 'what is that to you, in what way turning my head I will eat'?
