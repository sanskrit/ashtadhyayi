sutra: हीने
vRtti: हीने द्योत्येऽयमनुः कर्मप्रवचनीय संज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: "The word _anu_ is _karma_-_pravachaniya_ when it is used in the sense of inferior or subordinate to."
---
The word हीन means 'inferior,' and being a comparative term requires the other term with which comparison is made and which is superior; to complete the sense. In other words अनु governs the person to which others are inferior, in the accusative case. As अनुशाकटायनवैयाकरणाः 'all grammarians are inferior to _Sakatayana_.'
