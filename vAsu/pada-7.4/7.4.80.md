sutra: ओः पुयण्ज्यपरे
vRtti: सनीति वर्त्तते इदिति च ॥ उवर्णान्ताभ्यासस्य पवर्गे यणि जकारे चावर्णपरे परत इकारादेशो भवति सनि प्रत्यये परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: इ is substituted for the final उ or ऊ of a reduplicate, before a labial, a semi-vowel and before ज्, when अ or आ follows these consonants, in the Desiderative.

The word पु-यण्-जि is the Locative singular of the _samahara_ _dvandva_ compound of those three words-पु, यण् and ज् ॥ The _samasanta_ affix टच् (5.4.106) does not come, as these affixes are _anitya_. The word अ-परे means that after which is the letter अ ॥

Thus: 1. Labial:-  पिपविषते, पिपावयिषति, विभावयिषति; 2. Semi-vowel:- यियविषति, यियावयिषति, रिरावयिषति, लिलावयिषति; 3. ज-जिजावयिषति from the root जु ॥

The word पिपविषते is from पू, which gets इट् augment in सन् (7.2.74), then there is _guna_, and अत् substitutions, but these latter being _sthanivat_ for reduplication (1.1.59), पू is doubled: and for ऊ there is substituted इ by the present _sutra_. पिपावयिषति is the Desiderative of the Causative of पू ॥ विभावयिषति is the Desiderative of the Causative of भू ॥ यियविषति is the Desiderative of यु 'to mix', which is सेट् by (7.2.49). यियावयिषति is the Desiderative of the Causative of this root. The words रिरावयिषति and लिलावयिषति are the Desiderative of the Causatives of रौति and लुनाति ॥

This _sutra_ indicates the existence of the following maxim:- अद्विर्वचन निमित्तेऽपि स्थानिवद् भवति, "though not the cause of reduplication, the substitute which takes place when णि follows, becomes like the original". Thus in विभावयिषति we have भावि + सन् from भू + णि + सन्, here the आद् substitute caused by णि is _sthanivat_ to ऊ, otherwise there would be no उ in the reduplicate to be operated upon by the present _sutra_. See (6.1.31) also. Why do we say "for the उ or ऊ"? Observe पापच्यते, the Desiderative of which will be पापचिषति ॥ Why do we say "followed by a labial, semi-vowel or ज"? Observe अव नुनावयिषति, according to _Padamanjari_ it is अव तुता वयिषति from the _sautra_ root तु ॥ जुहावयिषति ॥ Why do we say 'when these consonants are followed by an अ'? Observe बुभूषति ॥
