sutra: कर्त्तर्युपमाने
vRtti: कर्त्तृवाचिनि उपमान उपपदे धातोर्णिनिप्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix णिनि comes after a verb when it is in composition with a word denoting an object of comparison, expressing the agent, the sense of the affix being \"doing something like that\", that is to say, when the _upapada_ agent is the standard of comparison of the agent denoted by the word to which the sense of the affix refers.

Thus उष्ट्र इव क्रोशति = उष्ट्रक्रोशिन् 'who makes a noise like a camel'; ध्वाङ्क्षराविन् 'who makes a noise like a crow'.

This _sutra_ applies where 'habit' is not indicated : or where 'genus' is denoted in opposition to the last aphorism.

Why do we say 'when expressing the agent'? Witness as अपूपानिव भक्षयति माषान् 'he eats _masha_ like _apupa_'. Here अपूपा is object and not agent, and hence no composition takes place.

Why do we say 'denoting a standard of comparison'? Otherwise there will be no composition. As उष्ट्रः क्रोशति 'the camel makes noise'. For the accents of these words, see (VI. 2. 80).
