sutra: अमावस्यदन्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: अमाशब्दः सहार्थेवर्त्तते, तस्मिन्नुपपदे वसेर्द्धातोः कालेऽधिकरणे ण्यत्प्रत्ययो भवति तत्रान्यतरस्यां वृद्ध्याभावो निपात्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: Optionally the word अमावस्या is irregularly formed.

The word अमा means 'along' or 'together'. अमा in composition with the root वस् 'to dwell", takes the affix ण्यत् in the sense of location of time. Optionally the _Vriddhi_ is not substituted in such a case. The time or the day on which the sun and the moon dwell together in the same constellation is called अमावास्या or अमावस्या.

The final त in अमावस्यत् is indicatory and is for the sake of showing where should the proper accent fall.

The two forms अमावस्या or अमावास्या are the same word, and a fortiori a rule made with regard to one will be made applicable to the other. And to this effect there is a _paribhasha_ which declares एकदेशविकृतस्यानन्यत्वम् ; 'that which has undergone a change in regard to one of its parts, is by no means in consequence of this change, something else than what it was before the change had taken place'. Therefore _sutra_(IV. 3. 30), though it, in terms, says अमावास्याया वा iş made applicable to the form अमावस्या also.
