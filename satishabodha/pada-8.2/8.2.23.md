 संयोगोन्तस्य लोपः 8.2.23 


वृत्तिः -- संयोगान्तं यत्पदं तस्य लोपः स्यात्। लोपः is ordained to the पदम् that ends in a conjunct consonant. As per 1.1.52, only the ending letter of the पदम् will take लोपः. 


Example continued: 


अनड्वान्ह् = अनड्वान् 8.2.23, 1.1.52 


Note: a) After 8.2.23 applies, 8.2.7 doesn’t get a chance to apply (and remove the ending नकार:) because of 8.2.1. b) Also, 8.2.31 doesn’t get a chance to apply (and change the ending हकार: to a ढकार:) because it has to wait for 8.2.23 (which is an earlier rule in the त्रिपादी section.) After 8.2.23 applies and the हकार: is lost then 8.2.31 cannot apply.
