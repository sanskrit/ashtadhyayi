sutra: विभाषा सुपो बहुच् पुरस्तात्तु
vRtti: ईषदसमाप्तिविशिष्टे वर्त्तमानात् सुबन्ताद्विभाषा बहुच् प्रत्ययो भवति, स च पुरस्तादेव भवति, न परतः ॥
vRtti_eng: Optionally to a declined noun may be added the affix बहुच् (बहु), but it stands before: when the sense is slight incompleteness.

This is the only exception to the general rule that an affix is added after a word. The affix बहुच् however is added before the word. The च् of बहुच् indicates that the _udatta_ will fall on the final vowel of the word. See (VI. I. 163). Thus बहुपटुः꣡ 'a tolerably skillful person'. बहुमृदुः꣡, बहुगुडा꣡ दाक्षाः ॥ By the word 'optionally' it is indicated that the affixes कल्प &c also come. By using the word सुपः 'to a noun ending in a case-affix i. e a declined noun', it is indicated that the affix is not added to finite verbs (तिङन्त) ॥
