sutra: प्राणिस्थादातो लजन्यतरस्याम्
vRtti: प्राणिस्थवाचिनः शब्दादाकारान्तात्लच् प्रत्ययो भवत्यन्यतरस्यां मत्वर्थे ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix _lach_ (ल) comes optionally, in the sense of _matup_, after a stem ending in long आ, the word expressing something which is found only in a living being.

Thus from चूडा 'a crest', we have चूडालः or चूडावान्. So also कर्णिकालः or कर्णिकावान् ॥ Why do we say 'which is found in a living being'? Observe शिखावान् प्रदीपः 'the crested flame of a lamp'. Why do we say "ending in आ"? Observe हस्तवान्, पादवान् ॥

Vart:- It should be stated that the affix लच् comes only after what denotes member or limb of a living being, (and not anything like love, passion, intelligence &c, that are also found in living being). Hence there is no affixing of लच् here : चिकीर्षाऽस्यास्ति = चिकीर्षावान्, जिहीर्षावान् ॥

Every affix is _udatta_ (3.1.3), unless contrary is indicated by some _anubandha_. The लच् would have been udatta by (3.1.3), even without the indicatory च् (V1. 1. 163). The employment of this _anubandha_, however indicates that this _udatta_ will never be changed into _svarita_, as other _udattas_ are by rule (8.2.6), as चूडालोऽसि ॥
