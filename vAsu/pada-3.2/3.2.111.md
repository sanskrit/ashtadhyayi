sutra: अनद्यतने लङ्
vRtti: अविद्यमानाद्यतने भूतेऽर्थे वर्तमानाद्धातोर्लङ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix लङ् comes after a verbal root employed in the sense of past before the commencement of the current day.

The word अनद्यतन is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound, meaning that which has not occurred during the course of the current day (_adyatana_). The whole of this affix is replaced by conjugational terminations, and the affix लङ् by itself denotes the Imperfect tense. As अकरोत् 'he did'; अहरत् 'he took'.

Why have we explained _anadyatana_ as a _Bahuvrihi_ compound? Because when there is a doubt as to the time, whether it was to-day or yesterday, there the Imperfect should not be used. As अद्य ह्यो वा अभुञ्ज्महि 'we ate to-day or yesterday'. In such a case the affix is लुङ्.

Vart:- The affix लङ् is also employed in signifying what is not witnessed by the narrator, when it relates to a well-known public event which can form the object of perception by the narrator. Thus in speaking of a recent public occurrence we may say :-अरुणद् यवनः साकेतम् 'the _Yavanas_ have besieged _Saketa_'; अरुणद् यवनः माध्यमिकान् 'the _Yavanas_ have besieged _Madhyamika_'.

Why do we say 'not witnessed by the speaker'? Observe उदगात् आदित्यः 'the sun arose'. Why do we say 'a popular public event' ? Observe चकार कट देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ has made the mat'. Why do we say 'which is the object of perception by the speaker'? Observe जघान कंसं किल वासुदेवः '_Vasudeva_ killed _Kansa_'.
