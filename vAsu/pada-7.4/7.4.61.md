sutra: शर्पूर्व्ः खयः
vRtti: अभ्यासस्य शर्पूर्वाः खयः शिष्यन्ते ॥
vRtti_eng: Of a reduplicate, the hard consonants (aspirate and unaspirate) when preceded by a sibilant, are only retained, the other consonants are elided.

---
As चुश्च्योतिषति, from _schyutir_ _ksharane_, तिष्ठासति, पिस्पन्दिषते ॥ Why do we say 'when preceded by a sibilant'? Observe पपाच ॥ Why do we say hard consonants? Observe सस्रौ ॥

Vart:- It should be said rather, a hard consonant preceded by a hard consonant or a sibilant is only retained : and the खर् consonants are elided : as in उचिच्छिषति, here उछ् becomes उच्छ् by the augment त् (तुक्); in the reduplicate the च् should be elided, and छ् retained out of च्छ; and not च् retained and छ् elided; for the च् represents त्, and if this were retained, it would be त् and not च् that would be heard : for by (8.2.1), the change of त् to च् is _asiddha_ for the purposes of this rule.
