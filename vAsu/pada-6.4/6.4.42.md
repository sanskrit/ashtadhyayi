Thus जातः, जातवान्, जातिः, सातः, सातवान्, सातिः, सिषासति; खातः, खातवान्, खातिः ॥ In जन् and खन् the Desiderative does not begin with a consonant, but takes the augment इट्, the न् is not therefore elided, as जिजनिषति, चिखनिषति ॥ In the case of the root सन्, the Desiderative takes इ, so we have two forms सिषासति and सिसनिषति (7.2.49). The Desiderative has, therefore, been mentioned in the aphorism, only for the sake of the root सन् ॥

If the phrase सन्झलोः be taken to mean 'the Desiderative beginning with a consonant', then we should read the _anuvritti_ of झालि क्ङिति from the preceding _sutras_, to complete the sense of this; and if the phrase means "when the Desiderative of a _jhaladi_ affix follows", then we should qualify the word Desiderative by the word _jhal_ from the preceding _sutras_. Or we may divide the _sutra_ into two (1) Before a कित् or ङित् _jhaladi_ affix long आ is the substitute of the न् of '_jan_', '_san_' and '_khan_'. (2) And so is the case, when the Desiderative affix follows, not having the augment इ, for then also the न् of '_jan_', '_san_' and '_khan_' is replaced by long आ ॥

The न् of the root सन् would have required elision by (6.4.37), because this verb belongs to _Tanadi_ class, still the आ substitution taught in this _sutra_ takes place, by preference, on the maxim of विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यम् (1.4.2). In fact, though in this section of _asiddha_ (6.4.22) one rule is considered as _asiddha_ for the purposes of the operations of another rule, yet one rule supersedes another by the maxim of _vipratisedha_. That that maxim applies in this section also, is to be inferred from the employment of the term हल् in (6.4.66), which supersedes the _lopa_ of आ taught in (6.4.64), and substitutes instead the long ई ॥
