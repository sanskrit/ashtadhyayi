sutra: माङि लुङ्
vRtti: माङ्युपपदे धातोर्लुङ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix \"_Lun_\" comes after a verb when the word \"_man_\" is used in connection with it.

This sets aside all other tense-affixes. As मा कार्षीत् 'let him not do' मा हार्षीत् 'Iet him not take'.

How have we then the Imperative and the Future tenses in the following sentence instead of the Aorist ? मा भवतु तस्य पापं मा भविष्यति । This sentence is against good usage. Or, we may explain it by saying that there is another मा which has not the indicatory ङ; and with that मा, other tenses may be used. The augment is elided after the prohibitive participle मा, by (VI. 4. 74).
