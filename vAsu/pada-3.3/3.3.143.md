sutra: विभाषा कथमि लिङ् च
vRtti: कथंशब्द उपपदे गर्हायां गम्यमानायां धातोर्लिङ्प्रत्ययो भवति, चकाराल्लट्च ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_Lin_' as well as '_Lat_' is optionally employed after a root, when the word '_katham_' is in construction with it, and censure is implied.

The word 'censure' is understood, and by च we draw लट् from the previous _sutra_ into this. By using the word 'optionally' in the aphorism, it is indicated that this rule does not exclude the application of the alternative tenses which would otherwise have been required by the time of the action. It is not total exclusion like the last. Thus कथं नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयेत् or याजयति or याजयिष्यति 'Indeed, how your honor can (or will) sacrifice for a _Sudra_'.

So also, कथं नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयिता, अयाजयत् or याजयाञ्चकार ।

Here there is an occasion for the application of the Potential mood (लिङ्); therefore when we intend to express non-completion of action in the past time, we can optionally employ the Conditional also (लृङ्). As कथं नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलम् अयाजयिष्यत् or याजयेत् 'Indeed, why did your honor (attempt to) sacrifice for that _Sudra_ (in vain)'.

Under similar circumstances, in denoting future time, the Conditional (लृङ्) must invariably be employed (III.3.139); as, कथं धर्मम् अत्यजिष्यः 'why will you (attempt to) give up your duty'.
