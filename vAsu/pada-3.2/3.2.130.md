sutra: इङ्धार्योः शत्रकृच्छ्रिणि
vRtti: इङो धारेश्च धात्वोः शतृप्रत्ययो भवति अकृच्छ्रिणि कर्त्तरि ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix शतृ comes after the verbs इङ् \"to go\" and धारि \"to hold\" in denoting that the agent does the action without trouble.

The word अकृच्छ्र means that which is accomplished by the agent with ease and facility. As अधीयन् पारायणम् 'the facile reading of the _Purana_'; धारयन्नुपनिषदम् 'easily mastering the _Upanishad_'. The root धारि is causative of धृ and means here 'to master'.
 
Why do we say 'when facility is indicated'? Otherwise कृच्छ्रेणाधीते 'he reads with difficulty'; कृच्छ्रेण धारयति 'he remembers with difficulty'.
