sutra: कषादिषु यथाविध्यनुप्रयोगः
vRtti: निमूलसमूलयोरित्येतदारभ्य कषादयः, एतेषु यथाविध्वनुप्रयोगो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The same verb should be employed after the gerunds formed from the verbs '_kash_' &c; as the verb from which the gerund is derived.

From _sutra_ (III. 4. 34) up to _sutra_ (III. 4. 45), a verb from the same root must be employed in the subsequent part, as _anuprayoga_, from which the gerund in _namul_ was formed. This rule has been illustrated in the examples under the previous aphorisms.

The present is a restrictive or _niyama_ rule. This chapter deals with affixes employed in denoting syntactical relation between two verbs (धातुसम्बन्धे प्रत्ययाः)। See (III. 4. 1) : so a gerund in _namul_, would, of course, be followed by some verb as _anuprayoga_; the present _sutra_ declares that the other verb must be from the same root as the gerund.
