sutra: अधिकरणे शेते
vRtti: शेतेर्धातोरधिकरणे सुबन्त उपपदेऽच्प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix अच् comes after the verb शी 'to lie down' when in composition with a case-inflected word indicating location, i. e., in the locative case.

The word सुप् (III. 2. 4) a noun ending in a case-affix is understood in this aphorism. As खे शेते = खशयः 'who lies in the sky'.

Vart:- The affix अच् comes after the verb शी when in composition with the words पार्श्व 'ribs', &c., though not necessarily denoting location; as पार्श्वाभ्यां शेते = पार्श्वशयः 'who reclines on his sides', उदरशयः 'who lies on his stomach', पृष्ठशयः 'who lies on his back'.

Vart:- And when the verb शी is preceded by the word दिग्धसह; as दिग्धेन सह शेते = दिग्धसहशयः ॥

Vart:- So also when the words उत्तान &c. are in composition with it denoting agent and in the nominative case. As उत्तानः शेते = उत्तानशयः I अवमूर्द्धा शेते = अवमूर्द्धाशयः ।

Vart:- In the _Chhandas_ the affix डच् comes after the verb शी when in composition with the word गिरि in the locative. As गिरौ शेते = गिरिशः 'who lies on the mountain'.

The letter ड of डच् is indicatory denoting that there is elision of the final vowel with what follows it (I. I. 64).
