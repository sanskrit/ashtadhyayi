sutra: समर्थानां प्रथमाद्वा
vRtti: त्रयमप्यधिक्रियते, समर्थानामिति च, प्रथमादिति च वेति च, स्वार्थिकप्रत्ययावधिश्चायमधिकारः । प्राग्दिशो विभक्तिरिति यावत् । स्वार्थिकेषु ह्यस्योपयोगो नास्ति, विकल्पोपि तत्रानवस्थितः, के चिन्नित्यमेव भवन्ति । लक्षणवाक्यानि :-- तस्थापत्यं, तेन रक्तं रागात्, तत्रभव, इत्येवमादीनि भविष्यन्ति । तेषु सामर्थ्ये सति प्रथमनिर्दिष्टादेव विकल्पेन प्रत्ययो भवतीति वेदितव्यम् ॥ समर्थ्यानामिति निर्द्धारणे षष्ठी । समर्थानां मध्ये प्रथमं प्रत्ययप्रकृतित्वेन निर्द्धार्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The _Taddhita_ affixes, on the alternative of their being employed at all, come after the word that is signified by the first of the words in construction in an aphorism.

All the three words, viz. (1) समर्थानां 'of the words in construction' (2) प्रथमात् 'after the first'; (3) वा 'on the alternative', exert a governing influence on the subsequent aphorisms, up to the aphorisms which leave to the words their own denotation : that is to say, up to the end of the second chapter of the fifth Book; before the beginning of the _sutra_ प्राग्दिशो विभक्तिः (V. 3. 1). The present _sutra_ as a whole, of course, has no applicability to the affixes which leave to the words their own denotation (स्वार्थिक); for the latter affixes are in many cases compulsory and not optional, as are the affixes to be taught hereafter in Book Fourth and the first and second chapters of Book Fifth.

These affixes will come after the word, that is signified by the first of the words in construction, in an aphorism. Thus (IV. 1. 92) declares तस्यापत्यम् 'his son'. Here the first word is तस्य 'his', therefore, the affixes forming the patronymics will come after the word signified by 'his': i.e. after the word in the genitive case. As उपगोरपत्यं = ओपगवः 'the son of _Upagu_'. Here the affix अण् comes after the word उपगु which is the first word representing '_tasya_' in the genitive case in the sentence उपगोरपत्यम् ॥ Similarly in the _sutra_ तेनरक्त रागात् (IV. 2. 1); here the first word is तेन, therefore, the affix will be added to the word in the instrumental case in a sentence representing the word तेन 'by which'; as कषायेण रक्तं वस्त्रं = काषायं, '_Kashaya_ is a cloth, coloured by _Kashaya_'. Similarly in _sutra_ तत्र भवः 'there staying' (IV. 3. 53.) here the first word is तत्र, 'there', in the locative case, therefore the affix will be optionally added to the word in the locative case in a sentence, representing the word तत्र 'there' : as स्रुघ्ने भवः = स्रौघ्नः "who stays in _Srughna_'.

The word समर्थानाम् is the genitive plural of समर्थ, and the force of the genitive is that of specification or '_nirdharana_':- i. e. 'among the words in construction, the first is specifically pointed out as the _prakriti_ or base, to which the affix is to be added'. Why do we say "among the words in construction"? Witness कम्बल उपगोरपत्यं देवदत्तस्य 'the blanket of _Upagu_; the son of _Devadatta_'. Here the two words उपगोरपत्यं are not in construction, for उपगोः governs कम्बलः, and अपत्यं is governed by देवदत्तस्य ॥ Why do we say "after the first"? So that the affix may come after the first word उपगोः in the genitive case, and not after अपत्यं which is in the nominative case, Why do we say "in the alternative" ? Because the same idea may also be expressed by a sentence; thus we may say उपगोरपत्यं, instead of the _Taddhita_ formed word औपगवः ॥ The same idea may also be expressed by a compound word (_samasa_); as उपग्वपत्यम् 'the son of _Upagu_'. In fact, the _samasa_ rule here is not superseded by _ Taddhita_-rule, as it otherwise would have been by (1. 4. 2.) because the _anuvritti_ of अन्यतरस्याम् is understood here: so that in the alternative when the _Taddhita_ affix is not employed, the _samasa_ rules will find scope.

This _sutra_ has been thus rendered by Dr. Bohtlingk: "when hence forth the meaning is specified in which an affix is to be added, then one should know that the rule applies to the first of those words which are associated with one another in sense, and that the affix is optional".
