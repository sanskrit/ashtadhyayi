sutra: कृत्याश्च
vRtti: कृत्यसंज्ञकाश्च प्रत्यया आवश्यकाधमर्ण्ययोरुपाधिभूतयोर्धातोर्भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes called '_kritya_' also come after a root when the sense to be indicated is that of 'necessity or obligation'.

Thus भवता खलु अवश्यं कटः कर्त्तव्यः, करणीयः, कार्यः or कृत्यः 'you ought to make the mat'; भवता शतं दातव्यं, देयं, &c, 'you ought to pay a hundred'.

Q.-- Where is the necessity of this aphorism ? The _kritya_ affixes, being enjoined universally without any limitation would, of course, come under these special circumstances also.

A.-- They would be excluded by the special affix णिनि of the last _sutra_, which comes especially with the force of 'necessity' and 'obligation'.

Q.-- Not so, for णिनि comes in denoting the 'agent' (कर्ता), while _kritya_ denotes the 'action' (भाव) and the 'object' (कर्म); so their scope being different, how can one supersede the other ?

A.-- Well, to remove this objection, some say, that _kritya_ words like भव्य, गेय &c. (3.4.68) which especially refer to the agent, are the proper examples to be given under this aphorism; and not examples of _kritya_-formed words in general.
