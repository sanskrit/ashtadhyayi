sutra: सृ स्थिरे
vRtti: सर्त्तेर्द्धातोः स्थिरे कर्त्तरि घञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_ghan_' comes after the verb '_sri_' (to move) when the agent is permanently fixed.
---
The word स्थिर means an object remaining steady throughout any period of time. That which thus remaining permanent moves through any interval of time, will apply to the agent of the verb. Thus, सृ + घञ् = सारः 'an essence'; as चन्दनसारः 'the essence of sandal', खदिरसारः 'the essence of catechu'.

Why do we say 'permanently fixed'? Observe सर्त्ता 'moves', सारकः 'that which flows'.

Vart:- The word so formed also applies to disease, fish and strength. As अतिसारः 'dysentery'; विसारः 'a fish'; सारः 'strength'.
