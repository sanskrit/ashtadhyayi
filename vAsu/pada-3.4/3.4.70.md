sutra: तयोरेव कृत्यक्तखलर्थाः
vRtti: तयोरेव भावकर्मणोः कृत्यसंज्ञकाः क्तखलार्थाश्च प्रत्यया भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes called '_kritya_' and the affix '_kta_' and those that have the sense of '_khal_', have only these last two senses, namely, an action and an object. (_bhava_ and _karma_).

The word तयोः 'of those two' refers to भाव 'an Impersonal act', and कर्म, 'object'. The word एव 'only' is used in the _sutra_ to exclude the word 'agent' from it. Thus कर्तव्यः कटो भवता 'the mat must be made by you'; भोक्तव्यः ओदनो भवता 'the rice must be eaten by you'. Here the affix तव्य has the force of denoting the object; we may, therefore, call it the Potential Passive Participle affix. So also आशितव्यं भवता 'thou must eat'; शयितव्यं भवता 'thou must lie down'. Here the sense of the affix तव्य being that of the action itself, which being Impersonal, is in the singular number, as it is one only, and neither male nor female, there is, from the nature of the case, a singular affix, and the neuter gender is employed.

Similarly the affix क्त denotes both the object and the action; कृतः कटो भवता 'the mat is made by you'; भुक्त ओदनो भवता 'the rice is eaten by you'. Here त is used with the force of denoting the object and may be called the past passive participle.

Similarly त may be used in denoting the mere act; आसितं भवता 'you sat'; शयितं भवता 'you lay down'.

Similarly the affixes having the sense of खल् (III. 3. 126) denote both the object and the Impersonal act. In the following examples the affixes denote the object; ईषत्करः कटो भवता 'this mat is made, by little at a time, by you'; सुकरः 'what is made with ease'; दुष्करः 'what is made with difficulty'. In the following examples the affixes denote the act; ईषदाढ्यंभवं भवता and स्वाढ्यंभवं भवता ।

After transitive verbs, the _kritya_, the _kta_ and the _khalartha_ affixes only denote the object, but never denote the भाव or 'an Impersonal action'.
