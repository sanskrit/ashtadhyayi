sutra: उदि अयतियौतिपूद्रुवः
vRtti: उच्छब्दउपपदे श्रयत्वादिभ्यो घञ् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix \"_ghan_\" comes after the verbs \"_sri_\", \"_yu_\", \"_pu_\" and \"_dru_\", when the preposition \"_ut_\" is in composition.

This debars the affix _ach_ (III. 3. 56). Thus उच्छ्रायः 'rising of a planet'; उद्यावः 'mixing'; उत्पावः 'purifying ghee'; and उद्रावः 'flight'.

How do you explain the form समुच्छ्रयः in पतनान्ताः समुच्छ्रयाः ? The word विभाषा 'optionally' in the next _sutra_, exerts a retrospective effect on this _sutra_, and the form is an optional one. This is a most unusual thing and is called सिंहावलोकनन्यायः 'the maxim of the lion's backward glance'. It is used when one casts a retrospective glance at what he has left behind, while at the same time he is proceeding, just as the lion, while going onward in search of prey, now and then bonds his neck backwards to see if any thing be within its reach.
