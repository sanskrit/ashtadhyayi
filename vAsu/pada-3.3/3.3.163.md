sutra: प्रैषातिसर्गप्राप्तकालेषु कृत्याश्च
vRtti: प्रेषणं प्रैषः, कामचाराभ्यनुज्ञानमतिसर्गः, निमित्तभूतस्य कालस्यावसरः प्राप्तकालः, एतेष्वर्थेषु धातोः कृत्यसंज्ञकाः प्रत्यया भवन्ति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affixes called '_Kritya_', and the affix '_Lot_' come also after verbs, in the sense of direction, granting permission, and proper (particular) time.
---
The word प्रैष means 'direction'; अतिसर्गः means 'permission to do as one likes'; प्राप्तकालः means 'arrival of appropriate occasion or time for the doing of an action'. The force of च is to introduce the word लोट् into this aphorism. Thus भवता कटः करणीयः, कर्तव्यः, or कृत्यः or कार्यः 'you must, (may, or it is proper time for you to) make the mat'.

So instead of the Passive Potential Participles, for such the _Kritya_ affix (III. 1. 95) &c)) may properly be called; we may have the Imperative also. Thus करोतु कटं  'you must (may or it is the appropriate time to) make the mat'.
 
It might be asked 'Why the _kritya_ affixes are enjoined to come with the force of direction, permission &c'. They have been ordained most generically to come in denoting action in the Abstract (भाव) and object (कर्म) and a fortiori they will come in denoting the senses of direction, permission & c; for the latter are but a species of action. If you say that लोट् being ordained in these special senses, will (on the principle, that an _apavada_ or special rule excludes an _utsarga_ or general rule within the jurisdiction of such special rule) exclude _kritya_ affixes; we would reply, that _kritya_ affixes will not be excluded, for the rule of non-uniform affixes (III. 1. 94) will apply'.

To this objection we answer 'the special mention of the word _kritya_ in this _sutra_, indicates the existence of the following maxim :--

'The rule of non-uniform affixes (III. 1. 94) does not necessarily apply in all cases after _sutra_ (III. 3. 94) treating of primary affixes by which feminine nouns are formed'.

Q.-- What is the difference between the words विधि and प्रैष ? Some say विधि means a precept enjoining something for the first time; while प्रैष means mere 'direction'.
