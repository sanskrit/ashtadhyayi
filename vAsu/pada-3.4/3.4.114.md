sutra: आर्द्धधातुकं शेषः
vRtti: तिङः शितश्च वर्जयित्वाऽन्यः प्रत्ययः शेषो धातुसंशब्दनेन विहित आर्द्धधातुकसंज्ञो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The remainder, i. e. the affixes other than '_tin_', and those with an indicatory '_s_' subjoined to a verbal root, are called '_ardhadhatuka_'.

Thus the affixes तृ, तुम्, तव्यम् &c. are आर्धधातुक affixes as in the following words- लविता, लवितुम्, लवितव्यम् । Here the augment इट् is added, because of these affixes being called _ardhadhatuka_ by (VII. 2. 35).

The word धातोः whose _anuvritti_ began with _sutra_ (III. 1. 91), is understood here also. So that the affixes in relation to the verbal roots get the name of _sarvadhatuka_ and _ardhadhatuka_; the affixes applied to nouns do not get these names. Thus the case-affix भ्याम् when added to the noun लू, is not called an _arthadhatuka_ affix, and therefore we have लूभ्याम्, लूभिः &c. Had these affixes been _ardhadhatuka_, they would have caused the _guna_ of the base (VII. 3. 84). Similarly the affixes त्वं and ता in the words वृक्षत्वं and वृक्षता are not _ardhadhatuka_ affixes. Had they been so, there would have been the insertion of the augment इट् (VII. 2. 35).

Similarly in _sutra_ (III. I. 5), the affix सन् is used without changing the sense, after the roots गुप्, तिज् and कित् । But as this affix is added without the enunciation of the word धातोः as it is in _sutra_ (III. 1. 7), this सन् is not called _ardhadhatuka_, and does not take the augment इट्, as जुगुप्सते ।
