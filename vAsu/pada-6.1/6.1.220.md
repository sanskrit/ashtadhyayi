Thus अजिरवती꣡, खदिरवती꣡, हंसवती꣡, कारण्डवती꣡ ॥ These words being formed by ङीप् would have been unaccented on the final (3.1.4). Why do we use अवती and not वती? Then the rule would apply to राजवती also, for this word is really that राजन्वती ending in अन्वती, the subsequent elision of न् is held to be non-valid for the purposes of the application of this rule (8.2.2). But the change of म into व (मत् = वत्) is considered _asiddha_ for the purposes of this rule.
