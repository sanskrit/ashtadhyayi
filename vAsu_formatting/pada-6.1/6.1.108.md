sutra: संप्रसारणाच्च
vRtti: पूर्व इत्येव । संप्रसारणादचि परतः पूर्वपरयोः स्थाने पूर्व एकादेशो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: There is the single substitution of the first vowel for the vocalised semivowel and the subsequent vowel.

---
The word पूर्व is understood here. When a vocalised semi-vowel is followed by a vowel, the vocalised vowel is alone substituted, the subsequent vowel merging in it. Thus यज् + क्त = इअज् + क्त (6.1.15) = इष्टम् (इ + अ = इ); so उप्तम् (वप् + क्त = उअय् + त), ग्रह् + इत = गृअह् + इत = गृहीतं ॥
Had there not been this merging, the vocalisation would become either useless or the two vowels would have been heard separately without _sandhi_. Thus in वप् + त = उअप् + त, if the अ did not merge in उ, then it would cause _sandhi_, and उ would be changed to व् by इकोयणचि and the word would again assume the form वप् ॥ But this यणादेश would causes _samprasarana_ rule non-effective, hence it follows that but for the present rule, the two vowels would have been heard separately as उ अप्त ॥

The rule of option in the _Chhandas_ (6.1.106) applies here also. Thus we have यज्यमानौ मित्रावरुणौ or इज्यमानौ ॥ "When you have just said that the two vowels will remain separate and there will be no यणादेश when there is no _purvavad_-_bhava_  we do you form यज्यमान्; it ought to be इ अज्यमान्"? We have only said that vocalisation rule becomes useless if there was not this rule of merging of the subsequent vowel; but where there is this rule of _purva_-_vad_-_bhava_, and only an option is allowed, then the rule of vocalisation does not become totally useless because it finds its scope in cases like इष्टः &c, therefore when in the alternative it is not applied, there यणादेश will take place naturally, and this ordinary rules of _sandhi_ will apply. The merging, moreover, refers to the vowel which is in the same _anga_ or base with the _samprasarana_. Thus शकान् ह्वयात = शकह्वा + क्विप् = शकह् उ आ = शखू ॥ Here आ which is in the same अङ्ग with हु merges in to उ ॥ But in forming the dual, we have शकहू + औ ॥ Here औ coming after the _samprasarana_ ऊ does not merge therein, and we have शकह्वौ ॥ Similarly शकहू + अर्थं = शकह्वर्थम् ॥ In fact when once the _para_-_purvatva_ has taken effect, then subsequent vowels will produce their effect because in the _antaranga_ operation इ अ ष्ट into इष्ट, the _purva_-_rupa_ is ordained to save the _samprasarana_ from modification, but there is no such necessity when a _Bahiranga_ operation is to be applied.
