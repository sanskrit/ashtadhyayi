sutra: अन्यथैवंकथमित्थंसुसिद्धाप्रयोगश्चेत्
vRtti: अन्यथादिषूपपदेषु कृञो णमुल् प्रत्ययो भवति सिद्धाप्रयोगश्चेत्करोतेर्भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: When the words '_anyatha_' (otherwise), '_evam_' (so), '_katham_' (how) and '_ittham_' (thus) are compounded with the verb, then '_namul_' comes after '_kri_' (to make), if it be such that its omission would be unobjectionable.

When is the non-employment of कृञ् valid ? When the same sentence will remain correct by omitting कृ, i. e. when without employing it, the same idea will be expressed. Thus अन्यथाकारं, एवंकारं, कथंकारं or इत्थंकारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats otherwise, he eats so, how does he eat, or he eats thus'. In fact, the sentence अन्यथाकारं भुङ्क्ते is equivalent to अन्यथा भुङ्क्ते ।

Why do we say 'if the non-employment would be valid'? Witness अन्यथा कृत्वा शिरो भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having turned his head aside'. Here कृञ् could not be spared.
