sutra: अन्येष्वपि दृश्यते
vRtti: अन्येष्वप्युपपदेषु कारकेषु जनेर्डः प्रत्ययो दृश्यते ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix ड is seen to come after the verb जन् with a past signification, though it be in composition with other nouns, having cases other than those mentioned in the previous _sutras_.

Thus the locative case has been dealt with in _sutra_ (III. 2. 97); but the affix comes when the _upapada_ has any other case than the seventh. As न जायते = अजः 'unborn'; द्विर्जातः = द्विजः 'twice-born'.

Thus, it is said in _sutra_ (III. 2. 98) that the _upapada_ may be in the ablative case, when genus is not denoted. We see, however, the affix employed when genus is denoted. As ब्राह्मणजो धर्मः; क्षत्रियजं युद्धम् ।

It is declared in _sutra_ (III. 2. 98) that when appellative is meant, the affix ड comes after the compound verb जन्. We find, however, the affix employed when the sense is not simply appellative; as अभिजाः or परिजाः 'born or produced all round i.e. hair'.

It is declared in _sutra_ (III. 2. 100.). 'When an object is in composition with the verb अनुजम् this affix is employed'. But it may also be employed when no object is in composition. As अनुजः 'born after i. e. younger brother'.

The force of the word अपि 'though' is to free this rule from all restrictions and conditions. So this affix comes after other verbs and other cases in composition with such verbs. As परितः खाता = परिखा 'a moat' (literally that which has been dug all round); आखा 'a pond'.
