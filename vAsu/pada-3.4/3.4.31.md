sutra: चर्मोदरयोः पूरेः
vRtti: चर्मोदरयोः कर्मणोरुपपदयोः पूरयतेर्णमुल् प्रत्ययो भवति ॥
vRtti_eng: The affix '_namul_' comes after the verb '_pur_' (to fill), when the words '_charman_' and '_udar_' are compounded with it as object.

Thus उदरपूरं भुंक्ते 'he eats so as to fill his belly'? चर्मपूरं स्तृणाति 'he spreads so as to cover the skin'.
