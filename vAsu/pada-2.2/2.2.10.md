sutra: न निर्द्धारणे ॥
vRtti: निर्द्धारणे या षष्ठी सा न समस्यते ॥	वार्त्तिकम् ॥प्रतिपदविधाना च षष्ठी न समस्यत इति वक्तव्यम् ॥
vRtti_eng: A word in the genitive case is not compounded with another, when the force of the sixth case affix is that of specification (_nirdharana_). 
---
With this sutra, begins a series of exceptions to the composition of words in the genitive case. The separation of one from the many, on account of its genus, attribute and action, is called '_nirdharana_.' As क्षत्रियो मनुष्याणां शूरतम: 'the _Kshatriya_ is the most powerful amongst men.' कृष्णा गवां संपन्नक्षीरतमः 'the black cow is the most milk-giving amongst cows.' धावन्नधगानां शीघ्रतमः 'the runner is the swiftest amongst walkers.' This form of genitive meaning 'amongst,' is ordained by _sutra_ II. 3. 41 . 

Vart:- A word taking a genitive-case by force of any rule other than _sutra_ II. 3. 50, is never compounded. See _sutra_ 8. Thus the following words are never compounded सर्पिषोज्ञानम् , मधुनोज्ञानम्.
