sutra: ईषद्दुःसुषु कृच्छ्राकृच्छ्रार्थेषु खल्
vRtti: ईषत् दुस् सु इत्येतेषूपपदेषु कृच्छ्राकृच्छ्रार्थेषु धातोः खल् प्रत्ययो भवति
vRtti_eng: In the sense of \"hard and difficult\" or \"light and easy\", the affix \"_khal_\" is added to a verb, when \"_ishad_\" and \"_dur_\" and \"_su_\" are combined with it as _upapadas_.

The _anuvritti_ of the phrase 'when related as instrument or location' ceases with this aphorism. The word कृच्छ्र means heavy, and दुर् has the force of conveying that sense. The word अकृच्छ्र means 'light, easy'; and the words ईषत् and सु convey that sense. Thus ईषत्करो भवता कटः 'a mat is made easily by you'; so also दुष्करः 'made with difficulty'; सुकरः 'made with ease'. Similarly ईषद्भोजः 'eating pleasantly'; दुर्भोजः and सुभोजः ।

Why do we say 'after ईषत् &c'.? See कृच्छ्रेण कार्यः कटः 'the mat which is made with difficulty'.

Why do we say 'when meaning 'hard or light'? Observe ईषत्कार्यं 'a small work'.

Of the affix खल्, the letter ख and ल् are indicatory; ख causing the insertion of a nasal (technically called मुम् augment, (VI. 3. 67)); and ल् regulates the accent (VI. 1. 196). The augment मुम् will be added in the subsequent _sutra_, the ख thus having no work in this _sutra_.
